       "['Book VI\\n\\nTHE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.\\n\\nSo here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off\\nto the country and city of the Phaeacians--a people who used to live in\\nthe fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes\\nwere stronger than they and plundered them, so their king Nausithous\\nmoved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from all other\\npeople. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and temples,\\nand divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone to\\nthe house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were inspired\\nof heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Minerva hie in\\nfurtherance of the return of Ulysses.\\n\\nShe went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there\\nslept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King\\nAlcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty,\\none on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well made\\nfolding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas\\'s\\ndaughter, who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age; then,\\ncoming up to the girl\\'s bedside like a breath of wind, she hovered over\\nher head and said:\\n\\n\"Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy\\ndaughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are going\\nto be married almost immediately, and should not only be well dressed\\nyourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend you. This is\\nthe way to get yourself a good name, and to make your father and mother\\nproud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a washing day,\\nand start at daybreak. I will come and help you so that you may have\\neverything ready as soon as possible, for all the best young men among\\nyour own people are courting you, and you are not going to remain a\\nmaid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have a waggon and mules\\nready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and girdles, and you\\ncan ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you than walking, for\\nthe washing-cisterns are some way from the town.\"\\n\\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say\\nis the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and\\nneither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine\\nand in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are\\nillumined for ever and ever. This was the place to which the goddess\\nwent when she had given instructions to the girl.\\n\\nBy and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering about\\nher dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell her\\nfather and mother all about it, and found them in their own room. Her\\nmother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her\\nmaids around her, and she happened to catch her father just as he was\\ngoing out to attend a meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian\\naldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:\\n\\n\"Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I want to\\ntake all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are the chief\\nman here, so it is only right that you should have a clean shirt when\\nyou attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five sons at\\nhome, two of them married, while the other three are good looking\\nbachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen when they go to\\na dance, and I have been thinking about all this.\"\\n\\nShe did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like to,\\nbut her father knew and said, \"You shall have the mules, my love, and\\nwhatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men shall\\nget you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold all your\\nclothes.\"\\n\\nOn this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon out,\\nharnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the clothes\\ndown from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her mother\\nprepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good things, and a\\ngoat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon, and her mother\\ngave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her women might anoint\\nthemselves. Then she took the whip and reins and lashed the mules on,\\nwhereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on the road. They pulled\\nwithout flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa and her wash of clothes,\\nbut the maids also who were with her.\\n\\nWhen they reached the water side they went to the washing cisterns,\\nthrough which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any\\nquantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules\\nand turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the\\nwater side. They took the clothes out of the waggon, put them in the\\nwater, and vied with one another in treading them in the pits to get the\\ndirt out. After they had washed them and got them quite clean, they laid\\nthem out by the sea side, where the waves had raised a high beach of\\nshingle, and set about washing themselves and anointing themselves with\\nolive oil. Then they got their dinner by the side of the stream, and\\nwaited for the sun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done\\ndinner they threw off the veils that covered their heads and began to\\nplay at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana goes\\nforth upon the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or\\ndeer, and the wood nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Jove, take their\\nsport along with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a\\nfull head taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest amid a whole\\nbevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine her handmaids.\\n\\nWhen it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the\\nclothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider how\\nUlysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct him\\nto the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at one\\nof the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. On this they\\nall shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, who sat up in his bed\\nof leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.\\n\\n\"Alas,\" said he to himself, \"what kind of people have I come amongst?\\nAre they cruel, savage, and uncivilised, or hospitable and humane? I\\nseem to hear the voices of young women, and they sound like those of\\nthe nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows of\\ngreen grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and women. Let me try\\nif I cannot manage to get a look at them.\"\\n\\nAs he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough\\ncovered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some\\nlion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength and\\ndefying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of\\noxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even\\ninto a well fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep--even such did\\nUlysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to them all naked as he\\nwas, for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt and so begrimed\\nwith salt water, the others scampered off along the spits that jutted\\nout into the sea, but the daughter of Alcinous stood firm, for Minerva\\nput courage into her heart and took away all fear from her. She stood\\nright in front of Ulysses, and he doubted whether he should go up to\\nher, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees as a suppliant, or\\nstay where he was and entreat her to give him some clothes and show him\\nthe way to the town. In the end he deemed it best to entreat her from a\\ndistance in case the girl should take offence at his coming near enough\\nto clasp her knees, so he addressed her in honeyed and persuasive\\nlanguage.\\n\\n\"O queen,\" he said, \"I implore your aid--but tell me, are you a goddess\\nor are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven, I\\ncan only conjecture that you are Jove\\'s daughter Diana, for your face\\nand figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a mortal\\nand live on earth, thrice happy are your father and mother--thrice\\nhappy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and delighted\\nthey must feel when they see so fair a scion as yourself going out to a\\ndance; most happy, however, of all will he be whose wedding gifts have\\nbeen the richest, and who takes you to his own home. I never yet saw any\\none so beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am lost in admiration as I\\nbehold you. I can only compare you to a young palm tree which I saw when\\nI was at Delos growing near the altar of Apollo--for I was there, too,\\nwith much people after me, when I was on that journey which has been the\\nsource of all my troubles. Never yet did such a young plant shoot out\\nof the ground as that was, and I admired and wondered at it exactly as I\\nnow admire and wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I\\nam in great distress; yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been\\ntossing about upon the sea. The winds and waves have taken me all the\\nway from the Ogygian island, {55} and now fate has flung me upon this\\ncoast that I may endure still further suffering; for I do not think that\\nI have yet come to the end of it, but rather that heaven has still much\\nevil in store for me.\\n\\n\"And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I\\nhave met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to\\nyour town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither to\\nwrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart\\'s\\ndesire--husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing\\nbetter in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a\\nhouse. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their friends\\nglad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.\"\\n\\nTo this Nausicaa answered, \"Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,\\nwell-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives\\nprosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what\\nhe has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now, however, that\\nyou have come to this our country, you shall not want for clothes nor\\nfor anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably look for.\\nI will show you the way to the town, and will tell you the name of our\\npeople; we are called Phaeacians, and I am daughter to Alcinous, in whom\\nthe whole power of the state is vested.\"\\n\\nThen she called her maids and said, \"Stay where you are, you girls. Can\\nyou not see a man without running away from him? Do you take him for a\\nrobber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do\\nus Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on a\\nland\\'s end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing to do with\\nany other people. This is only some poor man who has lost his way, and\\nwe must be kind to him, for strangers and foreigners in distress\\nare under Jove\\'s protection, and will take what they can get and be\\nthankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to eat and drink,\\nand wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from the\\nwind.\"\\n\\nOn this the maids left off running away and began calling one another\\nback. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told\\nthem, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the\\nlittle golden cruse of oil, and told him to go and wash in the stream.\\nBut Ulysses said, \"Young women, please to stand a little on one side\\nthat I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil,\\nfor it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I\\ncannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to\\nstrip {56} before a number of good looking young women.\"\\n\\nThen they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses\\nwashed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and\\nfrom his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and had\\ngot the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and put\\non the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then made him look\\ntaller and stronger than before, she also made the hair grow thick on\\nthe top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she\\nglorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful workman who has\\nstudied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva enriches a piece of\\nsilver plate by gilding it--and his work is full of beauty. Then he went\\nand sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young and\\nhandsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said to\\nher maids:\\n\\n\"Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who\\nlive in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw\\nhim I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of the gods\\nwho dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be just such\\nanother as he is, if he would only stay here and not want to go away.\\nHowever, give him something to eat and drink.\"\\n\\nThey did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and\\ndrank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.\\nMeanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen\\nfolded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she\\ntook her seat, she called Ulysses:\\n\\n\"Stranger,\" said she, \"rise and let us be going back to the town; I will\\nintroduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can tell you\\nthat you will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians. But be sure\\nand do as I bid you, for you seem to be a sensible person. As long as\\nwe are going past the fields and farm lands, follow briskly behind the\\nwaggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself. Presently,\\nhowever, we shall come to the town, where you will find a high wall\\nrunning all round it, and a good harbour on either side with a narrow\\nentrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the road side,\\nfor every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You will see the\\nmarket place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it, and paved\\nwith large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship\\'s gear\\nof all kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places\\nwhere oars are made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers;\\nthey know nothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and\\npride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which they travel\\nfar over the sea.\\n\\n\"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against\\nme later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low\\nfellow, if he met us, might say, \\'Who is this fine-looking stranger that\\nis going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose she is\\ngoing to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has taken\\nfrom some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbours; or some god has at\\nlast come down from heaven in answer to her prayers, and she is going to\\nlive with him all the rest of her life. It would be a good thing if she\\nwould take herself off and find a husband somewhere else, for she will\\nnot look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians who are in love\\nwith her.\\' This is the kind of disparaging remark that would be made\\nabout me, and I could not complain, for I should myself be scandalised\\nat seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with men in spite\\nof everybody, while her father and mother were still alive, and without\\nhaving been married in the face of all the world.\\n\\n\"If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help you\\nhome, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by the\\nroad side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow all\\nround it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about as far\\nfrom the town as a man\\'s voice will carry. Sit down there and wait for\\na while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach my father\\'s\\nhouse. Then, when you think we must have done this, come into the town\\nand ask the way to the house of my father Alcinous. You will have no\\ndifficulty in finding it; any child will point it out to you, for no one\\nelse in the whole town has anything like such a fine house as he has.\\nWhen you have got past the gates and through the outer court, go right\\nacross the inner court till you come to my mother. You will find her\\nsitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by firelight. It is a\\nfine sight to see her as she leans back against one of the bearing-posts\\nwith her maids all ranged behind her. Close to her seat stands that of\\nmy father, on which he sits and topes like an immortal god. Never mind\\nhim, but go up to my mother, and lay your hands upon her knees if you\\nwould get home quickly. If you can gain her over, you may hope to see\\nyour own country again, no matter how distant it may be.\"\\n\\nSo saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.\\nThe mules drew well, and their hoofs went up and down upon the road.\\nShe was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were\\nfollowing on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with\\njudgement. As the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove of\\nMinerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter of\\nJove.\\n\\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, hear\\nme now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was wrecking me.\\nNow, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends and\\nbe hospitably received by the Phaeacians.\"\\n\\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not show\\nherself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune, who was\\nstill furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting home.',\n",
       " 'BOOK III\\n\\n  Alexandria, also called Paris, challenges Menelaus--Helen and\\n  Priam view the Achaeans from the wall--The covenant--Paris\\n  and Menelaus fight, and Paris is worsted--Venus carries him\\n  off to save him--Scene between him and Helen.\\n\\nWhen the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain, the\\nTrojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that scream\\noverhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing waters of\\nOceanus to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies, and they wrangle\\nin the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched silently, in high\\nheart, and minded to stand by one another.\\n\\nAs when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain\\ntops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man\\ncan see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust\\nfrom under their feet as they made all speed over the plain.\\n\\nWhen they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward as\\nchampion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin of a\\npanther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shod with\\nbronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to meet him in\\nsingle fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before the ranks, and\\nwas glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase of some goat or\\nhorned stag, and devours it there and then, though dogs and youths set\\nupon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his eyes caught sight of\\nAlexandrus, for he deemed that now he should be revenged. He sprang,\\ntherefore, from his chariot, clad in his suit of armour.\\n\\nAlexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in fear\\nof his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back affrighted,\\ntrembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some\\nmountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into the throng of Trojan\\nwarriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the son of Atreus.\\n\\nThen Hector upbraided him. \"Paris,\" said he, \"evil-hearted Paris, fair\\nto see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had never\\nbeen born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live to be\\ndisgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock at us and\\nsay that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to see but who has\\nneither wit nor courage? Did you not, such as you are, get your\\nfollowing together and sail beyond the seas? Did you not from your a\\nfar country carry off a lovely woman wedded among a people of\\nwarriors--to bring sorrow upon your father, your city, and your whole\\ncountry, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness to\\nyourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what manner\\nof man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be your\\nlyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour, when\\nyou were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are a weak-kneed\\npeople, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones for the wrongs\\nyou have done them.\"\\n\\nAnd Alexandrus answered, \"Hector, your rebuke is just. You are hard as\\nthe axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the timber\\nto his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of your\\nscorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus has given\\nme; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the gods give\\nthem where they are minded, and none can have them for the asking. If\\nyou would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid the Trojans and Achaeans\\ntake their seats, while he and I fight in their midst for Helen and all\\nher wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the better\\nman take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his home, but let\\nthe rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby you Trojans shall\\nstay here in Troy, while the others go home to Argos and the land of\\nthe Achaeans.\"\\n\\nWhen Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan\\nranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and they all\\nsat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed at him with\\nstones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying, \"Hold,\\nArgives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to speak.\"\\n\\nThey ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. \"Hear from\\nmy mouth,\" said he, \"Trojans and Achaeans, the saying of Alexandrus,\\nthrough whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and\\nAchaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he and Menelaus fight\\nin the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be\\nvictorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all she\\nhas, to bear them to his own home, but let the rest swear to a solemn\\ncovenant of peace.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of the loud\\nbattle-cry addressed them. \"And now,\" he said, \"hear me too, for it is\\nI who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of Achaeans and\\nTrojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much have suffered\\nfor my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he did me. Let him who\\nshall die, die, and let the others fight no more. Bring, then, two\\nlambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for Earth and Sun, and we will\\nbring a third for Jove. Moreover, you shall bid Priam come, that he may\\nswear to the covenant himself; for his sons are high-handed and ill to\\ntrust, and the oaths of Jove must not be transgressed or taken in vain.\\nYoung men\\'s minds are light as air, but when an old man comes he looks\\nbefore and after, deeming that which shall be fairest upon both sides.\"\\n\\nThe Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they\\nthought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariots\\ntoward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying it\\ndown upon the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with a\\nlittle space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city to\\nbring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybius\\nto fetch the other lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon had\\nsaid.\\n\\nMeanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law, wife of\\nthe son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had married Laodice,\\nthe fairest of Priam\\'s daughters. She found her in her own room,\\nworking at a great web of purple linen, on which she was embroidering\\nthe battles between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars had made them fight\\nfor her sake. Iris then came close up to her and said, \"Come hither,\\nchild, and see the strange doings of the Trojans and Achaeans. Till now\\nthey have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but now\\nthey have left off fighting, and are leaning upon their shields,\\nsitting still with their spears planted beside them. Alexandrus and\\nMenelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are to be the wife\\nof him who is the victor.\"\\n\\nThus spoke the goddess, and Helen\\'s heart yearned after her former\\nhusband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over her\\nhead, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone, but\\nattended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus, and\\nClymene. And straightway they were at the Scaean gates.\\n\\nThe two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were seated\\nby the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus, Clytius,\\nand Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old to fight, but they\\nwere fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales that chirrup\\ndelicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood. When they saw\\nHelen coming towards the tower, they said softly to one another, \"Small\\nwonder that Trojans and Achaeans should endure so much and so long, for\\nthe sake of a woman so marvellously and divinely lovely. Still, fair\\nthough she be, let them take her and go, or she will breed sorrow for\\nus and for our children after us.\"\\n\\nBut Priam bade her draw nigh. \"My child,\" said he, \"take your seat in\\nfront of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmen and your\\nfriends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you who are to\\nblame. It is they that have brought about this terrible war with the\\nAchaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great and goodly? I\\nhave seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and so royal. Surely\\nhe must be a king.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" answered Helen, \"father of my husband, dear and reverend in my\\neyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here with\\nyour son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling daughter,\\nand all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to be, and my lot\\nis one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, the hero of whom you\\nask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and a brave soldier,\\nbrother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to my abhorred and miserable\\nself.\"\\n\\nThe old man marvelled at him and said, \"Happy son of Atreus, child of\\ngood fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in great\\nmultitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people of\\nOtreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river\\nSangarius; I was their ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers of\\nmen, came up against them, but even they were not so many as the\\nAchaeans.\"\\n\\nThe old man next looked upon Ulysses; \"Tell me,\" he said, \"who is that\\nother, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the chest\\nand shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalks in\\nfront of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his ewes.\"\\n\\nAnd Helen answered, \"He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of\\nLaertes. He was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner of\\nstratagems and subtle cunning.\"\\n\\nOn this Antenor said, \"Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once came\\nhere as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I received them in\\nmy own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and\\nconversation. When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans,\\nMenelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysses\\nhad the more royal presence. After a time they delivered their message,\\nand the speech of Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he did not say\\nmuch, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke very clearly and to\\nthe point, though he was the younger man of the two; Ulysses, on the\\nother hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silent and kept his\\neyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor graceful movement of\\nhis sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a man unpractised in\\noratory--one might have taken him for a mere churl or simpleton; but\\nwhen he raised his voice, and the words came driving from his deep\\nchest like winter snow before the wind, then there was none to touch\\nhim, and no man thought further of what he looked like.\"\\n\\nPriam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, \"Who is that great and\\ngoodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest of\\nthe Argives?\"\\n\\n\"That,\" answered Helen, \"is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, and on\\nthe other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus looking like\\na god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him. Often did\\nMenelaus receive him as a guest in our house when he came visiting us\\nfrom Crete. I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose names I could\\ntell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor, breaker of\\nhorses, and Pollux the mighty boxer; they are children of my mother,\\nand own brothers to myself. Either they have not left Lacedaemon, or\\nelse, though they have brought their ships, they will not show\\nthemselves in battle for the shame and disgrace that I have brought\\nupon them.\"\\n\\nShe knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the earth\\nin their own land of Lacedaemon.\\n\\nMeanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings through the\\ncity--two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth; and Idaeus\\nbrought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up to Priam and\\nsaid, \"Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans and Achaeans bid you\\ncome down on to the plain and swear to a solemn covenant. Alexandrus\\nand Menelaus are to fight for Helen in single combat, that she and all\\nher wealth may go with him who is the victor. We are to swear to a\\nsolemn covenant of peace whereby we others shall dwell here in Troy,\\nwhile the Achaeans return to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nThe old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the\\nhorses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot,\\ngathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside him;\\nthey then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. When they\\nreached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left the chariot,\\nand with measured pace advanced into the space between the hosts.\\n\\nAgamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants brought on\\nthe oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they poured\\nwater over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus drew the\\ndagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs\\' heads; this\\nthe men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaean princes, and\\nthe son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer. \"Father Jove,\" he\\ncried, \"that rulest in Ida, most glorious in power, and thou oh Sun,\\nthat seest and givest ear to all things, Earth and Rivers, and ye who\\nin the realms below chastise the soul of him that has broken his oath,\\nwitness these rites and guard them, that they be not vain. If\\nAlexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen and all her wealth, while\\nwe sail home with our ships; but if Menelaus kills Alexandrus, let the\\nTrojans give back Helen and all that she has; let them moreover pay\\nsuch fine to the Achaeans as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among\\nthose that shall be born hereafter. And if Priam and his sons refuse\\nsuch fine when Alexandrus has fallen, then will I stay here and fight\\non till I have got satisfaction.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, and\\nlaid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife had\\nreft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl\\ninto the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying, Trojans and\\nAchaeans among one another, \"Jove, most great and glorious, and ye\\nother everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them who shall first\\nsin against their oaths--of them and their children--may be shed upon\\nthe ground even as this wine, and let their wives become the slaves of\\nstrangers.\"\\n\\nThus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.\\nThen Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, \"Hear me, Trojans\\nand Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius: I\\ndare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and\\nMenelaus, for Jove and the other immortals alone know which shall fall.\"\\n\\nOn this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. He\\ngathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the two\\nthen went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, and\\ncast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim first.\\nMeanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed saying,\\n\"Father Jove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, grant that\\nhe who first brought about this war between us may die, and enter the\\nhouse of Hades, while we others remain at peace and abide by our oaths.\"\\n\\nGreat Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet, and\\nthe lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several\\nstations, each by his horses and the place where his arms were lying,\\nwhile Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodly armour.\\nFirst he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fitted with\\nancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of his brother\\nLycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung his silver-studded sword\\nof bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his\\ncomely head he set his helmet, well-wrought, with a crest of horse-hair\\nthat nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped a redoubtable spear\\nthat suited his hands. In like fashion Menelaus also put on his armour.\\n\\nWhen they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode fierce\\nof aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeans were\\nstruck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on the\\nmeasured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against the\\nother. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck the round shield of the son\\nof Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield turned its\\npoint. Menelaus next took aim, praying to Father Jove as he did so.\\n\"King Jove,\" he said, \"grant me revenge on Alexandrus who has wronged\\nme; subdue him under my hand that in ages yet to come a man may shrink\\nfrom doing ill deeds in the house of his host.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of\\nAlexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirt by\\nhis flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life. Then\\nthe son of Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projecting part of\\nhis helmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or four pieces from\\nhis hand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, \"Father Jove, of all\\ngods thou art the most despiteful; I made sure of my revenge, but the\\nsword has broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and I\\nhave not killed him.\"\\n\\nWith this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume of\\nhis helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. The strap of\\nthe helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and Menelaus would\\nhave dragged him off to his own great glory had not Jove\\'s daughter\\nVenus been quick to mark and to break the strap of oxhide, so that the\\nempty helmet came away in his hand. This he flung to his comrades among\\nthe Achaeans, and was again springing upon Alexandrus to run him\\nthrough with a spear, but Venus snatched him up in a moment (as a god\\ncan do), hid him under a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him to his own\\nbedchamber.\\n\\nThen she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with the\\nTrojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old woman who\\nused to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and of\\nwhom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed robe\\nand said, \"Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go to the house; he\\nis on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed in\\ngorgeous apparel. No one would think he had just come from fighting,\\nbut rather that he was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was\\nsitting down.\"\\n\\nWith these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she marked\\nthe beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and sparkling\\neyes, she marvelled at her and said, \"Goddess, why do you thus beguile\\nme? Are you going to send me afield still further to some man whom you\\nhave taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus has just vanquished\\nAlexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back with him. You are come\\nhere to betray me. Go sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth be\\ngoddess no longer; never let your feet carry you back to Olympus; worry\\nabout him and look after him till he make you his wife, or, for the\\nmatter of that, his slave--but me? I shall not go; I can garnish his\\nbed no longer; I should be a by-word among all the women of Troy.\\nBesides, I have trouble on my mind.\"\\n\\nVenus was very angry, and said, \"Bold hussy, do not provoke me; if you\\ndo, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as I have loved\\nyou. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and Achaeans, and you\\nshall come to a bad end.\"\\n\\nAt this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her and went\\nin silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the Trojan women.\\n\\nWhen they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set about\\ntheir work, but Helen went into her own room, and the laughter-loving\\ngoddess took a seat and set it for her facing Alexandrus. On this\\nHelen, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down, and with eyes askance\\nbegan to upbraid her husband.\\n\\n\"So you are come from the fight,\" said she; \"would that you had fallen\\nrather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. You used to\\nbrag that you were a better man with hands and spear than Menelaus. Go,\\nthen, and challenge him again--but I should advise you not to do so,\\nfor if you are foolish enough to meet him in single combat, you will\\nsoon fall by his spear.\"\\n\\nAnd Paris answered, \"Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches. This\\ntime, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me; another\\ntime I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that will stand by me.\\nCome, let us lie down together and make friends. Never yet was I so\\npassionately enamoured of you as at this moment--not even when I first\\ncarried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you--not even when\\nI had converse with you upon the couch of love in the island of Cranae\\nwas I so enthralled by desire of you as now.\" On this he led her\\ntowards the bed, and his wife went with him.\\n\\nThus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus\\nstrode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and no man,\\nneither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If they had\\nseen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of them hated\\nhim as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men, spoke,\\nsaying, \"Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The victory has been\\nwith Menelaus; therefore give back Helen with all her wealth, and pay\\nsuch fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among them that shall\\nbe born hereafter.\"\\n\\nThus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in applause.']"

       "['Book XXI\\n\\nTHE TRIAL OF THE AXES, DURING WHICH ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO EUMAEUS\\nAND PHILOETIUS\\n\\nMinerva now put it in Penelope\\'s mind to make the suitors try their\\nskill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves,\\nas a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and\\ngot the store-room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of\\nivory; she then went with her maidens into the store-room at the end of\\nthe house, where her husband\\'s treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought\\niron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver full of\\ndeadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in\\nLacedaemon--Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with one another\\nin Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in\\norder to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the\\nMessenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had\\nsailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these\\nUlysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and\\nthe other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had\\ngone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had lost,\\nand the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were the\\ndeath of him in the end, for when he went to the house of Jove\\'s son,\\nmighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules to his\\nshame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven\\'s\\nvengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set before\\nIphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares\\nhimself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave\\nhim the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on\\nhis death had been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return\\na sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship,\\nalthough they never visited at one another\\'s houses, for Jove\\'s son\\nHercules killed Iphitus ere they could do so. This bow, then, given him\\nby Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when he sailed for\\nTroy; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but had left it\\nbehind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.\\n\\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the\\ncarpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get\\nit quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the\\ndoors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the key,\\nand drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held the doors;\\n{161} these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a meadow,\\nand Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where the chests stood in\\nwhich the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with fragrant herbs:\\nreaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow case from the peg\\non which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as\\nshe took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved her,\\nshe went to the cloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and\\nthe quiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along\\nwith her came her maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron\\nand bronze which her husband had won as prizes. When she reached the\\nsuitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of\\nthe cloister, holding a veil before her face, and with a maid on either\\nside of her. Then she said:\\n\\n\"Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of\\nthis house because its owner has been long absent, and without other\\npretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize that\\nyou are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and\\nwhomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his arrow through\\neach one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this house of my\\nlawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in wealth. But even so I\\ndoubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron\\nbefore the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had\\nbidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master\\'s\\nbow, but Antinous scolded them. \"You country louts,\" said he, \"silly\\nsimpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by crying\\nin this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her husband;\\nsit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or go outside if\\nyou want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors shall have to\\ncontend for it with might and main, for we shall find it no light matter\\nto string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of us all who is\\nsuch another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember him, though I\\nwas then only a child.\"\\n\\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to\\nstring the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to\\nbe the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses,\\nwhom he was dishonouring in his own house--egging the others on to do so\\nalso.\\n\\nThen Telemachus spoke. \"Great heavens!\" he exclaimed, \"Jove must have\\nrobbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she\\nwill quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying\\nmyself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the\\ncontest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman whose\\npeer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca\\nnor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what need have I to\\nspeak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no excuses for delay,\\nbut let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too will make\\ntrial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I shall\\nnot suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can\\nwin the prizes which my father won before me.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him,\\nand took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, in\\na long groove which he had dug for them, and had made straight by line.\\n{162} Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was\\nsurprised when they saw him set them up so orderly, though he had never\\nseen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement\\nto make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his\\nmight to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though he had\\nhoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for\\nthe fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign to\\ncheck him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\\n\\n\"Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too\\nyoung, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able\\nto hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are\\nstronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.\"\\n\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led\\ninto the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow. Then\\nhe sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous said:\\n\\n\"Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the place\\nat which the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine.\"\\n\\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of Oenops was the first to rise. He\\nwas sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the\\nmixing-bowl. {163} He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and\\nwas indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow and\\narrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he could not\\nstring the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard work, they\\ntherefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, \"My friends, I\\ncannot string it; let another have it, this bow shall take the life and\\nsoul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live\\nafter having missed the prize that we have so long striven for, and\\nwhich has brought us so long together. Some one of us is even now hoping\\nand praying that he may marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow\\nand tried it, let him woo and make bridal offerings to some other woman,\\nand let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it\\nis to win her.\"\\n\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door, {164}\\nwith the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his\\nseat again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him\\nsaying:\\n\\n\"Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and\\nintolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow\\ntake the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend\\nit yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are\\nothers who will soon string it.\"\\n\\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, \"Look sharp, light a fire in\\nthe court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also\\na large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm the\\nbow and grease it--we will then make trial of it again, and bring the\\ncontest to an end.\"\\n\\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside\\nit. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the\\nhouse, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but\\nthey were none of them nearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless\\nthere still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders\\namong the suitors and much the foremost among them all.\\n\\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and\\nUlysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the outer\\nyard, Ulysses said to them quietly:\\n\\n\"Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in\\ndoubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of\\nmen would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back\\nhere all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do--to side with the\\nsuitors, or with Ulysses?\"\\n\\n\"Father Jove,\" answered the stockman, \"would indeed that you might so\\nordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see\\nwith what might and main I would fight for him.\"\\n\\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return;\\nwhen, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses\\nsaid, \"It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last,\\nin the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find that you\\ntwo alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so, for I\\nhave not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two,\\ntherefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven shall\\ndeliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both of you,\\nwill give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me\\nas though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give\\nyou convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is\\nthe scar from the boar\\'s tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on\\nMt. Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they\\nhad examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw\\ntheir arms round him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses\\nkissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down\\nupon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and said:\\n\\n\"Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and\\ntell those who are within. When you go in, do so separately, not both\\ntogether; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; let this\\nmoreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try to\\nprevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you, therefore,\\nEumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it about, and\\ntell the women to close the doors of their apartment. If they hear any\\ngroaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not\\ncome out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work.\\nAnd I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer court,\\nand to bind them securely at once.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat\\nthat he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\\n\\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming\\nit by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly\\ngrieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, \"I grieve for myself and for us\\nall; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care\\nnearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca\\nand elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so inferior to\\nUlysses in strength that we cannot string his bow. This will disgrace us\\nin the eyes of those who are yet unborn.\"\\n\\n\"It shall not be so, Eurymachus,\" said Antinous, \"and you know it\\nyourself. Today is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can\\nstring a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side--as for the axes\\nthey can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the house\\nand take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups, that we\\nmay make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will\\ntell Melanthius to bring us in some goats tomorrow--the best he has; we\\ncan then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer, and again make\\ntrial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end.\"\\n\\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over\\nthe hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine\\nand water and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering.\\nThen, when they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as\\nhe desired, Ulysses craftily said:--\\n\\n\"Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am\\nminded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who\\nhas just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and\\nleave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give victory\\nto whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that I may\\nprove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I still have\\nas much strength as I used to have, or whether travel and neglect have\\nmade an end of it.\"\\n\\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow,\\nAntinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, \"Wretched creature, you\\nhave not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought\\nto think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your\\nbetters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others\\nhave had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other beggar\\nor stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves; the\\nwine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all those who\\ndrink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion when\\nhe was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When the wine had\\ngot into his head, he went mad and did ill deeds about the house of\\nPeirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they\\nrushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him\\nthrough the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore\\nthe burden of his crime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore,\\nthere was war between mankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon\\nhimself through his own drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that\\nit will go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find no mercy\\nfrom any one here, for we shall at once ship you off to king Echetus,\\nwho kills every one that comes near him: you will never get away alive,\\nso drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger\\nthan yourself.\"\\n\\nPenelope then spoke to him. \"Antinous,\" said she, \"it is not right that\\nyou should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house.\\nIf the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of\\nUlysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make me\\nhis wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in his mind:\\nnone of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would be out of all\\nreason.\"\\n\\n\"Queen Penelope,\" answered Eurymachus, \"we do not suppose that this man\\nwill take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest\\nsome of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go\\ngossiping about and say, \\'These suitors are a feeble folk; they are\\npaying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was\\nable to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung it\\nat once and sent an arrow through the iron.\\' This is what will be said,\\nand it will be a scandal against us.\"\\n\\n\"Eurymachus,\" Penelope answered, \"people who persist in eating up the\\nestate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect\\nothers to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as\\nyou think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built, he says\\nmoreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and let us see\\nwhether he can string it or no. I say--and it shall surely be--that if\\nApollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will give him a cloak\\nand shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and robbers,\\nand a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will see him sent\\nsafely wherever he wants to go.\"\\n\\nThen Telemachus said, \"Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in\\nthe islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any\\none have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the\\nother, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of the\\nbow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then, within the\\nhouse and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff,\\nand the ordering of your servants. This bow is a man\\'s matter, and mine\\nabove all others, for it is I who am master here.\"\\n\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son\\'s saying in her\\nheart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned\\nher dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.\\n\\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, but\\nthe suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one of\\nthem said, \"You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out of\\nyour wits? If Apollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your own\\nboarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place, and worry you to\\ndeath.\"\\n\\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow\\ndown then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other\\nside of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, \"Father Eumaeus,\\nbring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with\\nstones back to the country, for I am the better man of the two. I wish\\nI was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as I am\\nthan you, I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry, for they\\nmean mischief.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put them\\nin a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow on and\\nplaced it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called\\nEuryclea apart and said to her, \"Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to\\nclose the doors of the women\\'s apartments. If they hear any groaning or\\nuproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not to come out, but\\nare to keep quiet and stay where they are at their work.\"\\n\\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women\\'s\\napartments.\\n\\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of\\nthe outer court. There was a ship\\'s cable of byblus fibre lying in the\\ngatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in again,\\nresuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who\\nhad now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about,\\nand proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating into\\nits two horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards his\\nneighbour saying, \"This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has\\ngot one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike\\nstyle does the old vagabond handle it.\"\\n\\nAnother said, \"I hope he may be no more successful in other things than\\nhe is likely to be in stringing this bow.\"\\n\\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung it\\nas easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes\\nthe twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand\\nto prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the\\ntwittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour\\nas they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly as a\\nsign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the\\nson of scheming Saturn had sent him.\\n\\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table {165}--for those\\nwhich the Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the\\nquiver--he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of\\nthe arrow and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When\\nhe had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the\\nhandle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right\\nthrough them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemachus:\\n\\n\"Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I\\naimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong, and\\nnot as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for\\nthe Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight, and\\nthen otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are the\\ncrowning ornaments of a banquet.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on\\nhis sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father\\'s seat.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XVI\\n\\n  Fire being now thrown on the ship of Protesilaus, Patroclus\\n  fights in the armour of Achilles--He drives the Trojans back,\\n  but is in the end killed by Euphorbus and Hector.\\n\\nTHUS did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclus drew\\nnear to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from some spring\\nwhose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice. When\\nAchilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said, \"Why,\\nPatroclus, do you stand there weeping like some silly child that comes\\nrunning to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried--she catches\\nhold of her mother\\'s dress to stay her though she is in a hurry, and\\nlooks tearfully up until her mother carries her--even such tears,\\nPatroclus, are you now shedding. Have you anything to say to the\\nMyrmidons or to myself? or have you had news from Phthia which you\\nalone know? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor is still alive, as also\\nPeleus son of Aeacus, among the Myrmidons--men whose loss we two should\\nbitterly deplore; or are you grieving about the Argives and the way in\\nwhich they are being killed at the ships, through their own high-handed\\ndoings? Do not hide anything from me but tell me that both of us may\\nknow about it.\"\\n\\nThen, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered, \"Achilles, son\\nof Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do not be angry, but I\\nweep for the disaster that has now befallen the Argives. All those who\\nhave been their champions so far are lying at the ships, wounded by\\nsword or spear. Brave Diomed son of Tydeus has been hit with a spear,\\nwhile famed Ulysses and Agamemnon have received sword-wounds; Eurypylus\\nagain has been struck with an arrow in the thigh; skilled apothecaries\\nare attending to these heroes, and healing them of their wounds; are\\nyou still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May it never be my lot to nurse\\nsuch a passion as you have done, to the baning of your own good name.\\nWho in future story will speak well of you unless you now save the\\nArgives from ruin? You know no pity; knight Peleus was not your father\\nnor Thetis your mother, but the grey sea bore you and the sheer cliffs\\nbegot you, so cruel and remorseless are you. If however you are kept\\nback through knowledge of some oracle, or if your mother Thetis has\\ntold you something from the mouth of Jove, at least send me and the\\nMyrmidons with me, if I may bring deliverance to the Danaans. Let me\\nmoreover wear your armour; the Trojans may thus mistake me for you and\\nquit the field, so that the hard-pressed sons of the Achaeans may have\\nbreathing time--which while they are fighting may hardly be. We who are\\nfresh might soon drive tired men back from our ships and tents to their\\nown city.\"\\n\\nHe knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own\\ndestruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, \"What, noble\\nPatroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am heeding,\\nnor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Jove, but I am cut\\nto the very heart that one of my own rank should dare to rob me because\\nhe is more powerful than I am. This, after all that I have gone\\nthrough, is more than I can endure. The girl whom the sons of the\\nAchaeans chose for me, whom I won as the fruit of my spear on having\\nsacked a city--her has King Agamemnon taken from me as though I were\\nsome common vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: no man may keep his\\nanger for ever; I said I would not relent till battle and the cry of\\nwar had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird my armour about\\nyour shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for the dark cloud of\\nTrojans has burst furiously over our fleet; the Argives are driven back\\non to the beach, cooped within a narrow space, and the whole people of\\nTroy has taken heart to sally out against them, because they see not\\nthe visor of my helmet gleaming near them. Had they seen this, there\\nwould not have been a creek nor grip that had not been filled with\\ntheir dead as they fled back again. And so it would have been, if only\\nKing Agamemnon had dealt fairly by me. As it is the Trojans have beset\\nour host. Diomed son of Tydeus no longer wields his spear to defend the\\nDanaans, neither have I heard the voice of the son of Atreus coming\\nfrom his hated head, whereas that of murderous Hector rings in my cars\\nas he gives orders to the Trojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and\\nfill the whole plain with their cry of battle. But even so, Patroclus,\\nfall upon them and save the fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and prevent\\nus from being able to return. Do, however, as I now bid you, that you\\nmay win me great honour from all the Danaans, and that they may restore\\nthe girl to me again and give me rich gifts into the bargain. When you\\nhave driven the Trojans from the ships, come back again. Though Juno\\'s\\nthundering husband should put triumph within your reach, do not fight\\nthe Trojans further in my absence, or you will rob me of glory that\\nshould be mine. And do not for lust of battle go on killing the Trojans\\nnor lead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest one of the ever-living gods\\nfrom Olympus attack you--for Phoebus Apollo loves them well: return\\nwhen you have freed the ships from peril, and let others wage war upon\\nthe plain. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that not a\\nsingle man of all the Trojans might be left alive, nor yet of the\\nArgives, but that we two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle\\nthat veils the brow of Troy.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground for\\nthe shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove and the\\njavelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamed\\nabout his temples rang with the continuous clatter of the missiles that\\nkept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protected his\\nface. Moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held his shield\\nso long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they would, they could not\\nmake him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the sweat rained\\nfrom every pore of his body, he had not a moment\\'s respite, and on all\\nsides he was beset by danger upon danger.\\n\\nAnd now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how fire\\nwas thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close up and let\\ndrive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax. He cut it clean\\nin two just behind where the point was fastened on to the shaft of the\\nspear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a headless spear, while the\\nbronze point flew some way off and came ringing down on to the ground.\\nAjax knew the hand of heaven in this, and was dismayed at seeing that\\nJove had now left him utterly defenceless and was willing victory for\\nthe Trojans. Therefore he drew back, and the Trojans flung fire upon\\nthe ship which was at once wrapped in flame.\\n\\nThe fire was now flaring about the ship\\'s stern, whereon Achilles smote\\nhis two thighs and said to Patroclus, \"Up, noble knight, for I see the\\nglare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroy our ships,\\nand there be no way by which we may retreat. Gird on your armour at\\nonce while I call our people together.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his legs with\\ngreaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver; after\\nthis he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus, richly inlaid and\\nstudded. He hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his\\nshoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his\\nhelmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly\\nabove it. He grasped two redoubtable spears that suited his hands, but\\nhe did not take the spear of noble Achilles, so stout and strong, for\\nnone other of the Achaeans could wield it, though Achilles could do so\\neasily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion, which Chiron had\\ncut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus, wherewith to deal out\\ndeath among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke his horses with all speed,\\nfor he was the man whom he held in honour next after Achilles, and on\\nwhose support in battle he could rely most firmly. Automedon therefore\\nyoked the fleet horses Xanthus and Balius, steeds that could fly like\\nthe wind: these were they whom the harpy Podarge bore to the west wind,\\nas she was grazing in a meadow by the waters of the river Oceanus. In\\nthe side traces he set the noble horse Pedasus, whom Achilles had\\nbrought away with him when he sacked the city of Eetion, and who,\\nmortal steed though he was, could take his place along with those that\\nwere immortal.\\n\\nMeanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and bade his\\nMyrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening wolves that are\\nfeasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon the mountains,\\nand their jaws are red with blood--they go in a pack to lap water from\\nthe clear spring with their long thin tongues; and they reek of blood\\nand slaughter; they know not what fear is, for it is hunger drives\\nthem--even so did the leaders and counsellors of the Myrmidons gather\\nround the good squire of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, and among them\\nstood Achilles himself cheering on both men and horses.\\n\\nFifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each there was a\\ncrew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom he could\\ntrust, while he was himself commander over them all. Menesthius of the\\ngleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius that streams from heaven,\\nwas captain of the first company. Fair Polydora daughter of Peleus bore\\nhim to ever-flowing Spercheius--a woman mated with a god--but he was\\ncalled son of Borus son of Perieres, with whom his mother was living as\\nhis wedded wife, and who gave great wealth to gain her. The second\\ncompany was led by noble Eudorus, son to an unwedded woman. Polymele,\\ndaughter of Phylas the graceful dancer, bore him; the mighty slayer of\\nArgos was enamoured of her as he saw her among the singing women at a\\ndance held in honour of Diana the rushing huntress of the golden\\narrows; he therefore--Mercury, giver of all good--went with her into an\\nupper chamber, and lay with her in secret, whereon she bore him a noble\\nson Eudorus, singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. When\\nIlithuia goddess of the pains of child-birth brought him to the light\\nof day, and he saw the face of the sun, mighty Echecles son of Actor\\ntook the mother to wife, and gave great wealth to gain her, but her\\nfather Phylas brought the child up, and took care of him, doting as\\nfondly upon him as though he were his own son. The third company was\\nled by Pisander son of Maemalus, the finest spearman among all the\\nMyrmidons next to Achilles\\' own comrade Patroclus. The old knight\\nPhoenix was captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon, noble son of\\nLaerceus of the fifth.\\n\\nWhen Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with their\\ncaptains, he charged them straitly saying, \"Myrmidons, remember your\\nthreats against the Trojans while you were at the ships in the time of\\nmy anger, and you were all complaining of me. \\'Cruel son of Peleus,\\'\\nyou would say, \\'your mother must have suckled you on gall, so ruthless\\nare you. You keep us here at the ships against our will; if you are so\\nrelentless it were better we went home over the sea.\\' Often have you\\ngathered and thus chided with me. The hour is now come for those high\\nfeats of arms that you have so long been pining for, therefore keep\\nhigh hearts each one of you to do battle with the Trojans.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they serried\\ntheir companies yet more closely when they heard the words of their\\nking. As the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some high house\\nwhich is to give shelter from the winds--even so closely were the\\nhelmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shield pressed on\\nshield, helm on helm, and man on man; so close were they that the\\nhorse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of their helmets touched each\\nother as they bent their heads.\\n\\nIn front of them all two men put on their armour--Patroclus and\\nAutomedon--two men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. Then\\nAchilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chest\\nwhich silver-footed Thetis had given him to take on board ship, and\\nwhich she had filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and good\\nthick rugs. In this chest he had a cup of rare workmanship, from which\\nno man but himself might drink, nor would he make offering from it to\\nany other god save only to father Jove. He took the cup from the chest\\nand cleansed it with sulphur; this done he rinsed it clean water, and\\nafter he had washed his hands he drew wine. Then he stood in the middle\\nof the court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making his\\ndrink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen of Jove whose joy is in\\nthunder. \"King Jove,\" he cried, \"lord of Dodona, god of the Pelasgi,\\nwho dwellest afar, you who hold wintry Dodona in your sway, where your\\nprophets the Selli dwell around you with their feet unwashed and their\\ncouches made upon the ground--if you heard me when I prayed to you\\naforetime, and did me honour while you sent disaster on the Achaeans,\\nvouchsafe me now the fulfilment of yet this further prayer. I shall\\nstay here where my ships are lying, but I shall send my comrade into\\nbattle at the head of many Myrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Jove, that\\nvictory may go with him; put your courage into his heart that Hector\\nmay learn whether my squire is man enough to fight alone, or whether\\nhis might is only then so indomitable when I myself enter the turmoil\\nof war. Afterwards when he has chased the fight and the cry of battle\\nfrom the ships, grant that he may return unharmed, with his armour and\\nhis comrades, fighters in close combat.\"\\n\\nThus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part of it\\nhe did indeed vouchsafe him--but not the whole. He granted that\\nPatroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships, but refused\\nto let him come safely out of the fight.\\n\\nWhen he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilles went\\ninside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.\\n\\nThen he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fierce\\nfight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans.\\n\\nMeanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on till they\\nsprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out like wasps\\nwhose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children love to tease,\\nwhereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung--or again, if a\\nwayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident, every wasp will\\ncome flying out in a fury to defend his little ones--even with such\\nrage and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from their ships, and their\\ncry of battle rose heavenwards. Patroclus called out to his men at the\\ntop of his voice, \"Myrmidons, followers of Achilles son of Peleus, be\\nmen my friends, fight with might and with main, that we may win glory\\nfor the son of Peleus, who is far the foremost man at the ships of the\\nArgives--he, and his close fighting followers. The son of Atreus King\\nAgamemnon will thus learn his folly in showing no respect to the\\nbravest of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they fell in\\na body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the cry which the\\nAchaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave son of Menoetius\\nand his squire all gleaming in their armour, they were daunted and\\ntheir battalions were thrown into confusion, for they thought the fleet\\nson of Peleus must now have put aside his anger, and have been\\nreconciled to Agamemnon; every one, therefore, looked round about to\\nsee whither he might fly for safety.\\n\\nPatroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where men\\nwere packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of Protesilaus. He\\nhit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydon and\\nthe broad waters of the river Axius; the spear struck him on the right\\nshoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; on this his\\nmen were thrown into confusion, for by killing their leader, who was\\nthe finest soldier among them, Patroclus struck panic into them all. He\\nthus drove them from the ship and quenched the fire that was then\\nblazing--leaving the half-burnt ship to lie where it was. The Trojans\\nwere now driven back with a shout that rent the skies, while the\\nDanaans poured after them from their ships, shouting also without\\nceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of the thunder-cloud, spreads a dense\\ncanopy on the top of some lofty mountain, and all the peaks, the\\njutting headlands, and forest glades show out in the great light that\\nflashes from the bursting heavens, even so when the Danaans had now\\ndriven back the fire from their ships, they took breath for a little\\nwhile; but the fury of the fight was not yet over, for the Trojans were\\nnot driven back in utter rout, but still gave battle, and were ousted\\nfrom their ground only by sheer fighting.\\n\\nThe fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed one\\nanother when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetius first\\ndrove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he was turning\\nround; the point went clean through, and broke the bone so that he fell\\nforward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the chest, where it was\\nexposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. The son of\\nPhyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack him, and ere he could do so took\\naim at the upper part of his thigh, where the muscles are thicker than\\nin any other part; the spear tore through all the sinews of the leg,\\nand his eyes were closed in darkness. Of the sons of Nestor one,\\nAntilochus, speared Atymnius, driving the point of the spear through\\nhis throat, and down he fell. Maris then sprang on Antilochus in\\nhand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode the body spear\\nin hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him, and in a moment\\nhad struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow; his aim was\\ntrue, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root of his arm, and\\ntore them right down to the bone, so he fell heavily to the ground and\\nhis eyes were closed in darkness. Thus did these two noble comrades of\\nSarpedon go down to Erebus slain by the two sons of Nestor; they were\\nthe warrior sons of Amisodorus, who had reared the invincible Chimaera,\\nto the bane of many. Ajax son of Oileus sprang on Cleobulus and took\\nhim alive as he was entangled in the crush; but he killed him then and\\nthere by a sword-blow on the neck. The sword reeked with his blood,\\nwhile dark death and the strong hand of fate gripped him and closed his\\neyes.\\n\\nPeneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed each\\nother with their spears. They had both thrown without effect, so now\\nthey drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed crest of Peneleos\\'\\nhelmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smote Lycon on\\nthe neck under the ear. The blade sank so deep that the head was held\\non by nothing but the skin, and there was no more life left in him.\\nMeriones gave chase to Acamas on foot and caught him up just as he was\\nabout to mount his chariot; he drove a spear through his right shoulder\\nso that he fell headlong from the car, and his eyes were closed in\\ndarkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; the bronze point of\\nthe spear went clean through it beneath the brain, crashing in among\\nthe white bones and smashing them up. His teeth were all of them\\nknocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream from both his eyes;\\nit also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils, and the darkness\\nof death enfolded him round about.\\n\\nThus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his man. As\\nravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them when they are\\nalone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flock through the\\ncarelessness of the shepherd--and when the wolves see this they pounce\\nupon them at once because they cannot defend themselves--even so did\\nthe Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled with ill-omened cries in\\ntheir panic and had no more fight left in them.\\n\\nMeanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector, but\\nHector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well under cover\\nof his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the whizzing of the\\narrows and the heavy thud of the spears. He well knew that the fortunes\\nof the day had changed, but still stood his ground and tried to protect\\nhis comrades.\\n\\nAs when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of a clear\\nsky when Jove is brewing a gale--even with such panic stricken rout did\\nthe Trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going. Hector\\'s\\nfleet horses bore him and his armour out of the fight, and he left the\\nTrojan host penned in by the deep trench against their will. Many a\\nyoke of horses snapped the pole of their chariots in the trench and\\nleft their master\\'s car behind them. Patroclus gave chase, calling\\nimpetuously on the Danaans and full of fury against the Trojans, who,\\nbeing now no longer in a body, filled all the ways with their cries of\\npanic and rout; the air was darkened with the clouds of dust they\\nraised, and the horses strained every nerve in their flight from the\\ntents and ships towards the city.\\n\\nPatroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flying in\\nconfusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were being smashed\\nin all directions, and many a man came tumbling down from his own car\\nto fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroclus, whose immortal steeds,\\ngiven by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench at a bound as they\\nsped onward. He was intent on trying to get near Hector, for he had set\\nhis heart on spearing him, but Hector\\'s horses were now hurrying him\\naway. As the whole dark earth bows before some tempest on an autumn day\\nwhen Jove rains his hardest to punish men for giving crooked judgement\\nin their courts, and driving justice therefrom without heed to the\\ndecrees of heaven--all the rivers run full and the torrents tear many a\\nnew channel as they roar headlong from the mountains to the dark sea,\\nand it fares ill with the works of men--even such was the stress and\\nstrain of the Trojan horses in their flight.\\n\\nPatroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and drove\\nthem back to the ships. They were doing their best to reach the city,\\nbut he would not let them, and bore down on them between the river and\\nthe ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade did he then avenge. First he\\nhit Pronous with a spear on the chest where it was exposed near the rim\\nof his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground. Next he sprang on\\nThestor son of Enops, who was sitting all huddled up in his chariot,\\nfor he had lost his head and the reins had been torn out of his hands.\\nPatroclus went up to him and drove a spear into his right jaw; he thus\\nhooked him by the teeth and the spear pulled him over the rim of his\\ncar, as one who sits at the end of some jutting rock and draws a strong\\nfish out of the sea with a hook and a line--even so with his spear did\\nhe pull Thestor all gaping from his chariot; he then threw him down on\\nhis face and he died while falling. On this, as Erylaus was on coming\\nto attack him, he struck him full on the head with a stone, and his\\nbrains were all battered inside his helmet, whereon he fell headlong to\\nthe ground and the pangs of death took hold upon him. Then he laid low,\\none after the other, Erymas, Amphoterus, Epaltes, Tlepolemus, Echius\\nson of Damastor, Pyris, Ipheus, Euippus and Polymelus son of Argeas.\\n\\nNow when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics,\\nbeing overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked the Lycians\\nsaying. \"Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show your mettle; I\\nwill myself meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is so\\nmasterful; he has done us much hurt, and has stretched many a brave man\\nupon the ground.\"\\n\\nHe sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he saw\\nthis, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at one another\\nwith loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that scream\\nand tear at one another in some high mountain fastness.\\n\\nThe son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said to\\nJuno who was his wife and sister, \"Alas, that it should be the lot of\\nSarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand of Patroclus. I am\\nin two minds whether to catch him up out of the fight and set him down\\nsafe and sound in the fertile land of Lycia, or to let him now fall by\\nthe hand of the son of Menoetius.\"\\n\\nAnd Juno answered, \"Most dread son of Saturn, what is this that you are\\nsaying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has long been fated,\\nout of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we shall not all of us be\\nof your mind. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, that if\\nyou send Sarpedon safely to his own home, some other of the gods will\\nbe also wanting to escort his son out of battle, for there are many\\nsons of gods fighting round the city of Troy, and you will make every\\none jealous. If, however, you are fond of him and pity him, let him\\nindeed fall by the hand of Patroclus, but as soon as the life is gone\\nout of him, send Death and sweet Sleep to bear him off the field and\\ntake him to the broad lands of Lycia, where his brothers and his\\nkinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar, in due honour to the dead.\"\\n\\nThe sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood upon the\\nearth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to kill on the rich\\nplain of Troy far from his home.\\n\\nWhen they were now come close to one another Patroclus struck\\nThrasydemus, the brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of the\\nbelly, and killed him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroclus and\\nmissed him, but he struck the horse Pedasus in the right shoulder, and\\nit screamed aloud as it lay, groaning in the dust until the life went\\nout of it. The other two horses began to plunge; the pole of the\\nchariot cracked and they got entangled in the reins through the fall of\\nthe horse that was yoked along with them; but Automedon knew what to\\ndo; without the loss of a moment he drew the keen blade that hung by\\nhis sturdy thigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon the other two\\nrighted themselves, and pulling hard at the reins again went together\\ninto battle.\\n\\nSarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed him, the\\npoint of the spear passed over his left shoulder without hitting him.\\nPatroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from his hand\\nin vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds the\\never-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or tall pine\\nto which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains to make timber\\nfor ship-building--even so did he lie stretched at full length in front\\nof his chariot and horses, moaning and clutching at the blood-stained\\ndust. As when a lion springs with a bound upon a herd of cattle and\\nfastens on a great black bull which dies bellowing in its\\nclutches--even so did the leader of the Lycian warriors struggle in\\ndeath as he fell by the hand of Patroclus. He called on his trusty\\ncomrade and said, \"Glaucus, my brother, hero among heroes, put forth\\nall your strength, fight with might and main, now if ever quit yourself\\nlike a valiant soldier. First go about among the Lycian captains and\\nbid them fight for Sarpedon; then yourself also do battle to save my\\narmour from being taken. My name will haunt you henceforth and for ever\\nif the Achaeans rob me of my armour now that I have fallen at their\\nships. Do your very utmost and call all my people together.\"\\n\\nDeath closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on his\\nbreast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses came out\\nalong with it, and he drew out both spear-point and Sarpedon\\'s soul at\\nthe same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds, who were\\nwild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their lords.\\n\\nGlaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said, for\\nhe could not help him. He had to support his arm with his other hand,\\nbeing in great pain through the wound which Teucer\\'s arrow had given\\nhim when Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaucus, was assailing\\nit. Therefore he prayed to far-darting Apollo saying, \"Hear me O king\\nfrom your seat, may be in the rich land of Lycia, or may be in Troy,\\nfor in all places you can hear the prayer of one who is in distress, as\\nI now am. I have a grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain, there\\nis no staunching the blood, and my whole arm drags by reason of my\\nhurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor go among my foes and fight\\nthem, though our prince, Jove\\'s son Sarpedon, is slain. Jove defended\\nnot his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal me of my wound, ease my\\npain and grant me strength both to cheer on the Lycians and to fight\\nalong with them round the body of him who has fallen.\"\\n\\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain,\\nstaunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new strength.\\nGlaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god had\\nanswered his prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went among the Lycian\\ncaptains, and bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. From\\nthese he strode on among the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthous and\\nAgenor; he then went in search of Aeneas and Hector, and when he had\\nfound them he said, \"Hector, you have utterly forgotten your allies,\\nwho languish here for your sake far from friends and home while you do\\nnothing to support them. Sarpedon leader of the Lycian warriors has\\nfallen--he who was at once the right and might of Lycia; Mars has laid\\nhim low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand by him, my friends, and suffer\\nnot the Myrmidons to strip him of his armour, nor to treat his body\\nwith contumely in revenge for all the Danaans whom we have speared at\\nthe ships.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable grief;\\nfor Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the main stays of\\ntheir city, both as having much people with him, and himself the\\nforemost among them all. Led by Hector, who was infuriated by the fall\\nof Sarpedon, they made instantly for the Danaans with all their might,\\nwhile the undaunted spirit of Patroclus son of Menoetius cheered on the\\nAchaeans. First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, men who needed no bidding.\\n\"Ajaxes,\" said he, \"may it now please you to show yourselves the men\\nyou have always been, or even better--Sarpedon is fallen--he who was\\nfirst to overleap the wall of the Achaeans; let us take the body and\\noutrage it; let us strip the armour from his shoulders, and kill his\\ncomrades if they try to rescue his body.\"\\n\\nHe spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides,\\ntherefore, the Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and the Myrmidons\\nand Achaeans on the other, strengthened their battalions, and fought\\ndesperately about the body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercely the while.\\nMighty was the din of their armour as they came together, and Jove shed\\na thick darkness over the fight, to increase the toil of the battle\\nover the body of his son.\\n\\nAt first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for one of\\nthe best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son of noble\\nAgacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Budeum; but\\npresently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he took refuge\\nwith Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius the land of noble steeds\\nto fight the Trojans under Achilles. Hector now struck him on the head\\nwith a stone just as he had caught hold of the body, and his brains\\ninside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fell face foremost\\nupon the body of Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus was enraged by the\\ndeath of his comrade, and sped through the front ranks as swiftly as a\\nhawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings. Even so swiftly,\\nO noble knight Patroclus, did you make straight for the Lycians and\\nTrojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwith he struck Sthenelaus the son\\nof Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone, and broke the tendons that join\\nit to the head and spine. On this Hector and the front rank of his men\\ngave ground. As far as a man can throw a javelin when competing for\\nsome prize, or even in battle--so far did the Trojans now retreat\\nbefore the Achaeans. Glaucus, captain of the Lycians, was the first to\\nrally them, by killing Bathycles son of Chalcon who lived in Hellas and\\nwas the richest man among the Myrmidons. Glaucus turned round suddenly,\\njust as Bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of him,\\nand drove his spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon he fell\\nheavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a man filled the\\nAchaeans with dismay, while the Trojans were exultant, and came up in a\\nbody round the corpse. Nevertheless the Achaeans, mindful of their\\nprowess, bore straight down upon them.\\n\\nMeriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus son of\\nOnetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was honoured by the\\npeople as though he were a god. Meriones struck him under the jaw and\\near, so that life went out of him and the darkness of death laid hold\\nupon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hoping to hit him\\nunder the shield as he was advancing, but Meriones saw it coming and\\nstooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew past him and the\\npoint stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on quivering till\\nMars robbed it of its force. The spear, therefore, sped from Aeneas\\'s\\nhand in vain and fell quivering to the ground. Aeneas was angry and\\nsaid, \"Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if I had hit you my spear\\nwould soon have made an end of you.\"\\n\\nAnd Meriones answered, \"Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will not be\\nable to make an end of every one who comes against you. You are only a\\nmortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle of your\\nshield with my spear, however strong and self-confident you may be, I\\nshould soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life to Hades of the\\nnoble steeds.\"\\n\\nOn this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, \"Meriones, hero\\nthough you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my good\\nfriend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead body; some of\\nthem must go under ground first; blows for battle, and words for\\ncouncil; fight, therefore, and say nothing.\"\\n\\nHe led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. As the\\nsound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the mountains--and the\\nthud of their axes is heard afar--even such a din now rose from\\nearth-clash of bronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, as men smote\\neach other with their swords and spears pointed at both ends. A man had\\nneed of good eyesight now to know Sarpedon, so covered was he from head\\nto foot with spears and blood and dust. Men swarmed about the body, as\\nflies that buzz round the full milk-pails in spring when they are\\nbrimming with milk--even so did they gather round Sarpedon; nor did\\nJove turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the fight, but kept\\nlooking at it all the time, for he was settling how best to kill\\nPatroclus, and considering whether Hector should be allowed to end him\\nnow in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, and strip him of his\\narmour, or whether he should let him give yet further trouble to the\\nTrojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the brave squire of\\nAchilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and the Trojans back towards\\nthe city and take the lives of many. First, therefore, he made Hector\\nturn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot and fled, bidding the\\nother Trojans fly also, for he saw that the scales of Jove had turned\\nagainst him. Neither would the brave Lycians stand firm; they were\\ndismayed when they saw their king lying struck to the heart amid a heap\\nof corpses--for when the son of Saturn made the fight wax hot many had\\nfallen above him. The Achaeans, therefore stripped the gleaming armour\\nfrom his shoulders and the brave son of Menoetius gave it to his men to\\ntake to the ships. Then Jove lord of the storm-cloud said to Apollo,\\n\"Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you, and take Sarpedon out of range of the\\nweapons; cleanse the black blood from off him, and then bear him a long\\nway off where you may wash him in the river, anoint him with ambrosia,\\nand clothe him in immortal raiment; this done, commit him to the arms\\nof the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who will carry him\\nstraightway to the rich land of Lycia, where his brothers and kinsmen\\nwill inter him, and will raise both mound and pillar to his memory, in\\ndue honour to the dead.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father\\'s saying, and came down from\\nthe heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he took\\nSarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long way off,\\nwhere he washed him in the river, anointed him with ambrosia and\\nclothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him to the\\narms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who presently set\\nhim down in the rich land of Lycia.\\n\\nMeanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to Automedon,\\npursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and foolishness of his\\nheart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the son of Peleus, he would\\nhave escaped death and have been scatheless; but the counsels of Jove\\npass man\\'s understanding; he will put even a brave man to flight and\\nsnatch victory from his grasp, or again he will set him on to fight, as\\nhe now did when he put a high spirit into the heart of Patroclus.\\n\\nWho then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when the\\ngods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus, Autonous,\\nEcheclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor and Melanippus; after these\\nhe killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes. These he slew, but the rest\\nsaved themselves by flight.\\n\\nThe sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands of\\nPatroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not Phoebus Apollo\\ntaken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and to aid the\\nTrojans. Thrice did Patroclus charge at an angle of the high wall, and\\nthrice did Apollo beat him back, striking his shield with his own\\nimmortal hands. When Patroclus was coming on like a god for yet a\\nfourth time, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said, \"Draw\\nback, noble Patroclus, it is not your lot to sack the city of the\\nTrojan chieftains, nor yet will it be that of Achilles who is a far\\nbetter man than you are.\" On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew to some\\ndistance and avoided the anger of Apollo.\\n\\nMeanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean gates,\\nin doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or to call the\\narmy inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus Apollo drew near\\nhim in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior Asius, who was\\nHector\\'s uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son of Dymas who lived\\nin Phrygia by the waters of the river Sangarius; in his likeness Jove\\'s\\nson Apollo now spoke to Hector saying, \"Hector, why have you left off\\nfighting? It is ill done of you. If I were as much better a man than\\nyou, as I am worse, you should soon rue your slackness. Drive straight\\ntowards Patroclus, if so be that Apollo may grant you a triumph over\\nhim, and you may rule him.\"\\n\\nWith this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector bade\\nCebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among them, and\\nstruck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector and the\\nTrojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and killed no man, but\\ndrove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then sprang from his chariot to\\nthe ground, with a spear in his left hand, and in his right a jagged\\nstone as large as his hand could hold. He stood still and threw it, nor\\ndid it go far without hitting some one; the cast was not in vain, for\\nthe stone struck Cebriones, Hector\\'s charioteer, a bastard son of\\nPriam, as he held the reins in his hands. The stone hit him on the\\nforehead and drove his brows into his head for the bone was smashed,\\nand his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He dropped dead from his\\nchariot as though he were diving, and there was no more life left in\\nhim. Over him did you then vaunt, O knight Patroclus, saying, \"Bless my\\nheart, how active he is, and how well he dives. If we had been at sea\\nthis fellow would have dived from the ship\\'s side and brought up as\\nmany oysters as the whole crew could stomach, even in rough water, for\\nhe has dived beautifully off his chariot on to the ground. It seems,\\nthen, that there are divers also among the Trojans.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as it were,\\nof a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself struck in the\\nchest, and his courage is his own bane--even so furiously, O Patroclus,\\ndid you then spring upon Cebriones. Hector sprang also from his chariot\\nto the ground. The pair then fought over the body of Cebriones. As two\\nlions fight fiercely on some high mountain over the body of a stag that\\nthey have killed, even so did these two mighty warriors, Patroclus son\\nof Menoetius and brave Hector, hack and hew at one another over the\\ncorpse of Cebriones. Hector would not let him go when he had once got\\nhim by the head, while Patroclus kept fast hold of his feet, and a\\nfierce fight raged between the other Danaans and Trojans. As the east\\nand south wind buffet one another when they beat upon some dense forest\\non the mountains--there is beech and ash and spreading cornel; the top\\nof the trees roar as they beat on one another, and one can hear the\\nboughs cracking and breaking--even so did the Trojans and Achaeans\\nspring upon one another and lay about each other, and neither side\\nwould give way. Many a pointed spear fell to ground and many a winged\\narrow sped from its bow-string about the body of Cebriones; many a\\ngreat stone, moreover, beat on many a shield as they fought around his\\nbody, but there he lay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and\\nhugely, heedless of his driving now.\\n\\nSo long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of either\\nside were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he went down\\ntowards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans proved to be\\nbeyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew Cebriones out of range\\nof the darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the armour from\\nhis shoulders. Then Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierce intent and a\\nterrific shout upon the Trojans, and thrice did he kill nine men; but\\nas he was coming on like a god for a time, then, O Patroclus, was the\\nhour of your end approaching, for Phoebus fought you in fell earnest.\\nPatroclus did not see him as he moved about in the crush, for he was\\nenshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struck him from behind on his\\nback and his broad shoulders with the flat of his hand, so that his\\neyes turned dizzy. Phoebus Apollo beat the helmet from off his head,\\nand it rolled rattling off under the horses\\' feet, where its horse-hair\\nplumes were all begrimed with dust and blood. Never indeed had that\\nhelmet fared so before, for it had served to protect the head and\\ncomely forehead of the godlike hero Achilles. Now, however, Zeus\\ndelivered it over to be worn by Hector. Nevertheless the end of Hector\\nalso was near. The bronze-shod spear, so great and so strong, was\\nbroken in the hand of Patroclus, while his shield that covered him from\\nhead to foot fell to the ground as did also the band that held it, and\\nApollo undid the fastenings of his corslet.\\n\\nOn this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he stood as\\none dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a Dardanian, the best\\nspearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest runner,\\ncame behind him and struck him in the back with a spear, midway between\\nthe shoulders. This man as soon as ever he had come up with his chariot\\nhad dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts of\\nwar--he it was, O knight Patroclus, that first drove a weapon into you,\\nbut he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus then ran back into the\\ncrowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; he would not\\nstand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmed though he now was, to attack\\nhim; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the blow the god had given him\\nand by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of his men in fear for\\nhis life. Hector on this, seeing him to be wounded and giving ground,\\nforced his way through the ranks, and when close up with him struck him\\nin the lower part of the belly with a spear, driving the bronze point\\nright through it, so that he fell heavily to the ground to the great\\ngrief of the Achaeans. As when a lion has fought some fierce wild-boar\\nand worsted him--the two fight furiously upon the mountains over some\\nlittle fountain at which they would both drink, and the lion has beaten\\nthe boar till he can hardly breathe--even so did Hector son of Priam\\ntake the life of the brave son of Menoetius who had killed so many,\\nstriking him from close at hand, and vaunting over him the while.\\n\"Patroclus,\" said he, \"you deemed that you should sack our city, rob\\nour Trojan women of their freedom, and carry them off in your ships to\\nyour own country. Fool; Hector and his fleet horses were ever straining\\ntheir utmost to defend them. I am foremost of all the Trojan warriors\\nto stave the day of bondage from off them; as for you, vultures shall\\ndevour you here. Poor wretch, Achilles with all his bravery availed you\\nnothing; and yet I ween when you left him he charged you straitly\\nsaying, \\'Come not back to the ships, knight Patroclus, till you have\\nrent the bloodstained shirt of murderous Hector about his body.\\' Thus I\\nween did he charge you, and your fool\\'s heart answered him \\'yea\\' within\\nyou.\"\\n\\nThen, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight Patroclus:\\n\"Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturn and Apollo have\\nvouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquished me so easily,\\nand they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders; had twenty\\nsuch men as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen before my\\nspear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered me, and among mortal\\nmen Euphorbus; you are yourself third only in the killing of me. I say\\nfurther, and lay my saying to your heart, you too shall live but for a\\nlittle season; death and the day of your doom are close upon you, and\\nthey will lay you low by the hand of Achilles son of Aeacus.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul left\\nhis body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning its sad fate\\nand bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Dead though\\nhe was, Hector still spoke to him saying, \"Patroclus, why should you\\nthus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son of lovely Thetis,\\nmay be smitten by my spear and die before me?\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his foot\\nupon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. He then\\nwent spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet descendant of\\nAeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortal steeds which the\\ngods had given as a rich gift to Peleus bore him swiftly from the field.',\n",
       " 'BOOK V\\n\\n  The exploits of Diomed, who, though wounded by Pandarus,\\n  continues fighting--He kills Pandarus and wounds AEneas--Venus\\n  rescues AEneas, but being wounded by Diomed, commits him\\n  to the care of Apollo and goes to Olympus, where she is tended\\n  by her mother Dione--Mars encourages the Trojans, and\\n  AEneas returns to the fight cured of his wound--Minerva and\\n  Juno help the Achaeans, and by the advice of the former\\n  Diomed wounds Mars, who returns to Olympus to get cured.\\n\\nThen Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of Tydeus,\\nthat he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himself with\\nglory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet like\\nthe star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath in the\\nwaters of Oceanus--even such a fire did she kindle upon his head and\\nshoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly of the\\nfight.\\n\\nNow there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,\\npriest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus and\\nIdaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two came\\nforward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he being on\\nfoot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were close up to\\none another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over Diomed\\'s\\nleft shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw, and his spear\\nsped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and\\nhe fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother\\'s\\nbody, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight, or he would have\\nshared his brother\\'s fate; whereon Vulcan saved him by wrapping him in\\na cloud of darkness, that his old father might not be utterly\\noverwhelmed with grief; but the son of Tydeus drove off with the\\nhorses, and bade his followers take them to the ships. The Trojans were\\nscared when they saw the two sons of Dares, one of them in fright and\\nthe other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by\\nthe hand and said, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of\\ncities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out,\\nand see to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go\\naway, and thus avoid his anger.\"\\n\\nSo saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon the\\nsteep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the Trojans\\nback, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First King\\nAgamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his\\nchariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,\\njust as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the shoulders\\nand went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round\\nhim as he fell heavily to the ground.\\n\\nThen Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had come\\nfrom Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as he\\nwas mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded him as\\nhe fell heavily from the car.\\n\\nThe squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus, son\\nof Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a mighty huntsman\\nand keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill\\nevery kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but\\nneither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for the\\nspear of Menelaus struck him in the back as he was flying; it struck\\nhim between the shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he\\nfell headlong and his armour rang rattling round him.\\n\\nMeriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son of\\nHermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning\\nworkmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that\\nmade the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all\\nmischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus\\nhimself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him\\nas he was flying, and struck him on the right buttock. The point of the\\nspear went through the bone into the bladder, and death came upon him\\nas he cried aloud and fell forward on his knees.\\n\\nMeges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was a\\nbastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children, for\\nthe love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up to him\\nand drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under his tongue\\nall among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell dead in the\\ndust.\\n\\nAnd Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble\\nDolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was\\nhonoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him\\nchase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the\\narm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to\\nthe ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can\\nwithstand, came over his eyes.\\n\\nThus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of\\nTydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or the\\nTrojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has\\nburst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful\\nvineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, but\\nin a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that\\nmany a strong man\\'s hand has reclaimed--even so were the dense\\nphalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many\\nthough they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.\\n\\nNow when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving the\\nTrojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front part\\nof his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through the\\nmetal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with\\nblood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph, \"Knights Trojans,\\ncome on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold\\nout much longer if King Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from\\nLycia hither.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew\\nand made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.\\n\"Dear son of Capaneus,\" said he, \"come down from your chariot, and draw\\nthe arrow out of my shoulder.\"\\n\\nSthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound,\\nwhereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been made\\nin his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, \"Hear me, daughter of\\naegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well and\\nstood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant me\\nto come within a spear\\'s throw of that man and kill him. He has been\\ntoo quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting that I\\nshall not see the light of the sun much longer.\"\\n\\nThus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs supple\\nand quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to him and\\nsaid, \"Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I have set\\nin your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus. Moreover, I\\nhave withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods and men\\napart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle, do not\\nfight him; but should Jove\\'s daughter Venus come, strike her with your\\nspear and wound her.\"\\n\\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus again\\ntook his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierce\\neven than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain\\nshepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the wall\\nof a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has roused the brute\\nto fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter under cover of\\nthe buildings, while the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are\\nsmothered in heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps\\nout over the sheep-yard wall. Even thus did Diomed go furiously about\\namong the Trojans.\\n\\nHe killed Astynous, and Hypeiron shepherd of his people, the one with a\\nthrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with\\na sword-cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his neck\\nand back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas and\\nPolyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never came\\nback for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed made an\\nend of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two sons of\\nPhaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with\\nage, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomed took\\nboth their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he\\nnevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen divided\\nhis wealth among themselves.\\n\\nThen he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as they\\nwere both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on the\\nneck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice. For\\nall their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot and\\nstripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their horses to his\\ncomrades to take them back to the ships.\\n\\nWhen Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went through\\nthe fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandarus.\\nWhen he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, \"Pandarus, where is\\nnow your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer, in\\nrespect of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in Lycia\\nthat can beat you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an arrow at\\nthis fellow who is going so masterfully about, and has done such deadly\\nwork among the Trojans. He has killed many a brave man--unless indeed\\nhe is some god who is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices,\\nand and has set his hand against them in his displeasure.\"\\n\\nAnd the son of Lycaon answered, \"Aeneas, I take him for none other than\\nthe son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his helmet,\\nand by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if he is\\nthe man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without heaven\\'s\\nhelp, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud of\\ndarkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have\\ntaken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow\\nwent through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure I should\\nsend him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that I have not\\nkilled him. There must be a god who is angry with me. Moreover I have\\nneither horse nor chariot. In my father\\'s stables there are eleven\\nexcellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths\\nspread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses,\\nchamping barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again and again\\nwhen I was at home and on the point of starting, to take chariots and\\nhorses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle, but I would not\\nlisten to him; it would have been much better if I had done so, but I\\nwas thinking about the horses, which had been used to eat their fill,\\nand I was afraid that in such a great gathering of men they might be\\nill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot to Ilius armed only\\nwith my bow and arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have\\nalready hit two chieftains, the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and\\nthough I drew blood surely enough, I have only made them still more\\nfurious. I did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day I led my\\nband of Trojans to Ilius in Hector\\'s service, and if ever I get home\\nagain to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness of my\\nhouse, may some one cut my head off then and there if I do not break\\nthe bow and set it on a hot fire--such pranks as it plays me.\"\\n\\nAeneas answered, \"Say no more. Things will not mend till we two go\\nagainst this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial of\\narms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can\\nspeed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If Jove\\nagain vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us safely\\nback to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins while I stand\\nupon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man\\'s onset while I\\nlook after the horses.\"\\n\\n\"Aeneas,\" replied the son of Lycaon, \"take the reins and drive; if we\\nhave to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better for\\ntheir own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they expect\\nit they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the fight. The\\nson of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses. Therefore\\ndrive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my spear.\"\\n\\nThey then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son of\\nTydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to Diomed,\\n\"Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two heroes\\nspeeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful\\narcher, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is\\nAnchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us\\nretreat. Do not, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may get\\nkilled.\"\\n\\nDiomed looked angrily at him and answered: \"Talk not of flight, for I\\nshall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither flight nor\\nfear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount, but\\nwill go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid of\\nno man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall not take\\nboth back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart--if\\nMinerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay your\\nhorses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be\\nsure you spring Aeneas\\' horses and drive them from the Trojan to the\\nAchaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove gave to Tros in\\npayment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live and move\\nunder the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by putting his mares to\\nthem without Laomedon\\'s knowledge, and they bore him six foals. Four\\nare still in his stables, but he gave the other two to Aeneas. We shall\\nwin great glory if we can take them.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up to\\nthem, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. \"Great and mighty son,\" said\\nhe, \"of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will now try\\nwith my spear.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck the\\nshield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed on\\ntill it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted out\\nand said, \"You are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand out\\nfor long, and the glory of the fight is mine.\"\\n\\nBut Diomed all undismayed made answer, \"You have missed, not hit, and\\nbefore you two see the end of this matter one or other of you shall\\nglut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.\"\\n\\nWith this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus\\'s\\nnose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the\\nbronze point cut through the root of his tongue, coming out under his\\nchin, and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he fell\\nheavily to the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and he was\\nreft of life and strength.\\n\\nAeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing\\nlest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion\\nin the pride of strength, with shield and spear before him and a cry of\\nbattle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should dare face\\nhim. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge and great\\nthat as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore\\nit aloft with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin\\nwhere the hip turns in the joint that is called the \"cup-bone.\" The\\nstone crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged\\nedges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees, and propped\\nhimself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness of night\\nfell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of men, would have perished\\nthen and there, had not his mother, Jove\\'s daughter Venus, who had\\nconceived him by Anchises when he was herding cattle, been quick to\\nmark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her dear son. She\\nprotected him by covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest\\nsome Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him.\\n\\nThus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the son of\\nCapaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had given him. He\\nmade his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding the\\nreins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas\\'s horses\\nand drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he had so\\ndone he gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom he valued\\nabove all others as the one who was most like-minded with himself, to\\ntake them on to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot, seized\\nthe reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.\\n\\nNow the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear in\\nhand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses that\\ncan lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster of\\ncities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he flew\\nat her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand. The\\npoint tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven for\\nher, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her hand,\\nso that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the veins of the\\nblessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods do not eat\\nbread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and are\\nimmortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but Phoebus\\nApollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lest\\nsome Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him; and\\nDiomed shouted out as he left her, \"Daughter of Jove, leave war and\\nbattle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women? If\\nyou meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder at the\\nvery name of war.\"\\n\\nThe goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as the\\nwind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all\\nbesmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,\\nwith his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon she\\nfell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her have\\nhis horses. \"Dear brother,\" she cried, \"save me, and give me your\\nhorses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly wounded\\nby a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with father\\nJove.\"\\n\\nThus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She\\nmounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her\\nand took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew\\nforward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where\\nthe gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them from\\nthe chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus flung\\nherself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms about her\\nand caressed her, saying, \"Which of the heavenly beings has been\\ntreating you in this way, as though you had been doing something wrong\\nin the face of day?\"\\n\\nAnd laughter-loving Venus answered, \"Proud Diomed, the son of Tydeus,\\nwounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I love best\\nof all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between\\nTrojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with\\nthe immortals.\"\\n\\n\"Bear it, my child,\" replied Dione, \"and make the best of it. We\\ndwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, and\\nwe lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus and\\nEphialtes, children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay\\nthirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would have then\\nperished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, told\\nMercury, who stole him away when he was already well-nigh worn out by\\nthe severity of his bondage. Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son\\nof Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with a three-barbed\\narrow, and nothing could assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hades,\\nwhen this same man, the son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit him with an\\narrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went\\nto the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and full of pain; and the\\narrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great anguish till Paeeon\\nhealed him by spreading soothing herbs on the wound, for Hades was not\\nof mortal mould. Daring, head-strong, evildoer who recked not of his\\nsin in shooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. And now Minerva has\\negged this son of Tydeus on against yourself, fool that he is for not\\nreflecting that no man who fights with gods will live long or hear his\\nchildren prattling about his knees when he returns from battle. Let,\\nthen, the son of Tydeus see that he does not have to fight with one who\\nis stronger than you are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter\\nof Adrestus, rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of\\nher wedded lord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nSo saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with both\\nhands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But Minerva\\nand Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with their mocking\\ntalk, and Minerva was first to speak. \"Father Jove,\" said she, \"do not\\nbe angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must have been persuading\\nsome one of the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of whom she is so\\nvery fond, and while caressing one or other of them she must have torn\\nher delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman\\'s brooch.\"\\n\\nThe sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his side.\\n\"My child,\" said he, \"it has not been given you to be a warrior.\\nAttend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and\\nleave all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he knew\\nhim to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear the\\nmighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his\\narmour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay him,\\nand thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he was coming\\non for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo shouted to him\\nwith an awful voice and said, \"Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw off;\\nthink not to match yourself against gods, for men that walk the earth\\ncannot hold their own with the immortals.\"\\n\\nThe son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the anger\\nof the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set him in\\nsacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty\\nsanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to behold,\\nwhile Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness of\\nAeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans hacked\\nat the bucklers about one another\\'s breasts, hewing each other\\'s round\\nshields and light hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to\\nMars, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, can\\nyou not go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even\\nwith father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first went up to\\nthe Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and afterwards\\nsprang upon me too, as though he were a god.\"\\n\\nHe then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars went\\nabout among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the likeness\\nof fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. \"Sons of Priam,\" said he, \"how\\nlong will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the Achaeans?\\nWould you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas the son of\\nAnchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour as Hector\\nhimself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from the stress of\\nthe fight.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then Sarpedon\\nrebuked Hector very sternly. \"Hector,\" said he, \"where is your prowess\\nnow? You used to say that though you had neither people nor allies you\\ncould hold the town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law. I see\\nnot one of them here; they cower as hounds before a lion; it is we,\\nyour allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have come from afar,\\neven from Lycia and the banks of the river Xanthus, where I have left\\nmy wife, my infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy;\\nnevertheless, I head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground against any\\nwho would fight me though I have nothing here for the Achaeans to\\nplunder, while you look on, without even bidding your men stand firm in\\ndefence of their wives. See that you fall not into the hands of your\\nfoes as men caught in the meshes of a net, and they sack your fair city\\nforthwith. Keep this before your mind night and day, and beseech the\\ncaptains of your allies to hold on without flinching, and thus put away\\ntheir reproaches from you.\"\\n\\nSo spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang from\\nhis chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among the host\\nbrandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising the\\nterrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the Achaeans,\\nbut the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven back. As\\nthe breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor, when\\nmen are winnowing--while yellow Ceres blows with the wind to sift the\\nchaff from the grain, and the chaff-heaps grow whiter and whiter--even\\nso did the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses\\' hoofs raised\\nto the firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them back to\\nbattle, and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to\\nhelp the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and went about\\neverywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him that\\nwhen he saw Pallas Minerva leave the fray he was to put courage into\\nthe hearts of the Trojans--for it was she who was helping the Danaans.\\nThen Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his\\nheart with valour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who\\nwere overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage; but\\nthey could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busy\\nwith the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably in\\ntheir midst.\\n\\nThe two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless of\\nthe fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds which\\nthe son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there is no\\nair and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds whose\\nshrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions--even so did the\\nDanaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The son of\\nAtreus went about among them and exhorted them. \"My friends,\" said he,\\n\"quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one another\\'s\\neyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour more often\\nlive than get killed, but they that fly save neither life nor name.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the\\nfront rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the\\nTrojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was ever\\nquick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnon\\nstruck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayed it\\nnot. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly, and\\nhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\\n\\nThen Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and\\nOrsilochus. Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong city of\\nPhere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad stream\\nflows through the land of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilochus, who\\nruled over much people and was father to Diocles, who in his turn begat\\ntwin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of war.\\nThese, when they grew up, went to Ilius with the Argive fleet in the\\ncause of Menelaus and Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and there they both of\\nthem fell. As two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths of some\\nmountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattle\\ntill they get killed by the hand of man, so were these two vanquished\\nby Aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to the ground.\\n\\nBrave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the\\nfront, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars\\negged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by Aeneas;\\nbut Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward, fearing\\nthat the king might come to harm and thus bring all their labour to\\nnothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were setting their hands\\nand spears against one another eager to do battle, Antilochus placed\\nhimself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold though he was, drew back\\non seeing the two heroes side by side in front of him, so they drew the\\nbodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks of the Achaeans and\\ncommitted the two poor fellows into the hands of their comrades. They\\nthen turned back and fought in the front ranks.\\n\\nThey killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian\\nwarriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on\\nhis chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the\\nson of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with\\na stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell\\nfrom his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck\\nhim on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the\\nchariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and\\nshoulders buried deep in the dust--for he had fallen on sandy soil till\\nhis horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus\\nlashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.\\n\\nBut Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry\\nrushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.\\nMars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil of\\nbattle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now in\\nfront of Hector and now behind him.\\n\\nDiomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide\\nplain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river\\nrolling swiftly to the sea--he sees its boiling waters and starts back\\nin fear--even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to his\\nmen, \"My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spear so\\nwell? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now Mars is with\\nhim in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore towards\\nthe Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not fight with\\ngods.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men, both\\nin one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in war.\\nAjax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close up and\\nhurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man of great\\nwealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land, but his\\nlot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax struck\\nhim in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly, and he\\nfell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of\\nhis armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him, many of which fell\\nupon his shield. He planted his heel upon the body and drew out his\\nspear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him that he could not\\nstrip the goodly armour from his shoulders. The Trojan chieftains,\\nmoreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so that\\nhe dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though he was, they drove\\nhim from them and he was beaten back.\\n\\nThus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong hand\\nof fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both brave and\\nof great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and grandson of\\ngreat Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke first.\\n\"Sarpedon,\" said he, \"councillor of the Lycians, why should you come\\nskulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call you son of\\naegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were of old his\\nchildren. Far other was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted father,\\nwho came here for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had six ships\\nonly, and few men to follow him, sacked the city of Ilius and made a\\nwilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your people are\\nfalling from you. For all your strength, and all your coming from\\nLycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates of\\nHades vanquished by my hand.\"\\n\\nAnd Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, \"Tlepolemus, your\\nfather overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon\\'s folly in refusing\\npayment to one who had served him well. He would not give your father\\nthe horses which he had come so far to fetch. As for yourself, you\\nshall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and your\\nsoul to Hades of the noble steeds.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw at\\nthe same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his\\nthroat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell\\nupon his eyes. Tlepolemus\\'s spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh\\nwith such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone, but\\nhis father as yet warded off destruction from him.\\n\\nHis comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the\\nweight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in such\\nhaste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing the\\nspear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile the\\nAchaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon Ulysses was moved\\nto pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted whether\\nto pursue the son of Jove, or to make slaughter of the Lycian rank and\\nfile; it was not decreed, however, that he should slay the son of Jove;\\nMinerva, therefore, turned him against the main body of the Lycians. He\\nkilled Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and\\nPrytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not great Hector marked\\nhim, and sped to the front of the fight clad in his suit of mail,\\nfilling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad when he saw him\\ncoming, and besought him, saying, \"Son of Priam, let me not be here to\\nfall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me, and since I may not return\\nhome to gladden the hearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me die\\nwithin the walls of your city.\"\\n\\nHector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon the\\nAchaeans and kill many among them. His comrades then bore Sarpedon away\\nand laid him beneath Jove\\'s spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his friend and\\ncomrade, drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon fainted and a\\nmist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself again, for the\\nbreath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new life, and\\nbrought him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by Mars\\nand Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that Mars was\\nwith the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned\\ntowards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by Mars\\nand Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes the renowned\\ncharioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son of\\nOenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who was possessed of great\\nwealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians who\\nlived near him, owners of a fertile country.\\n\\nNow when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said to\\nMinerva, \"Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the\\npromise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he had sacked\\nthe city of Ilius will be of no effect if we let Mars rage thus\\nfuriously. Let us go into the fray at once.\"\\n\\nMinerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter of\\ngreat Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe with all\\nspeed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on either\\nside of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were of gold,\\nimperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze, wondrous to\\nbehold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round the axle\\nupon either side. The car itself was made with plaited bands of gold\\nand silver, and it had a double top-rail running all round it. From the\\nbody of the car there went a pole of silver, on to the end of which she\\nbound the golden yoke, with the bands of gold that were to go under the\\nnecks of the horses Then Juno put her steeds under the yoke, eager for\\nbattle and the war-cry.\\n\\nMeanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with her\\nown hands, on to her father\\'s threshold, and donned the shirt of Jove,\\narming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis about her\\nshoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and on it were\\nStrife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold; moreover there\\nwas the head of the dread monster Gorgon, grim and awful to behold,\\nportent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she set her helmet of gold,\\nwith four plumes, and coming to a peak both in front and behind--decked\\nwith the emblems of a hundred cities; then she stepped into her flaming\\nchariot and grasped the spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, with\\nwhich she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno\\nlashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew\\nopen of their own accord--gates over which the Hours preside, in whose\\nhands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides\\nthem, or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient\\nsteeds, and found the son of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost\\nridges of Olympus. There Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the\\nson of Saturn, lord of all. \"Father Jove,\" said she, \"are you not angry\\nwith Mars for these high doings? how great and goodly a host of the\\nAchaeans he has destroyed to my great grief, and without either right\\nor reason, while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their\\nease and setting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I\\nhope, Father Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard, and\\nchase him out of the battle.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him more\\noften than any one else does.\"\\n\\nJuno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward\\nnothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can see when\\nhe looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can the\\nloud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they\\nreached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simois and\\nScamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from the chariot.\\nShe hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosia spring up for\\nthem to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves in\\ntheir eagerness to help the Argives. When they came to the part where\\nthe bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty Diomed,\\nfighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance,\\nthere Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voiced\\nStentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together.\\n\"Argives,\" she cried; \"shame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblance\\nonly; as long as Achilles was fighting, if his spear was so deadly that\\nthe Trojans dared not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates, but\\nnow they sally far from the city and fight even at your ships.\"\\n\\nWith these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva\\nsprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his\\nchariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For\\nthe sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield\\nirritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up\\nthe strap to wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke\\nof his horses and said, \"The son of Tydeus is not such another as his\\nfather. Tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly\\ninto the fray even when I told him not to do so. When he went all\\nunattended as envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I bade\\nhim feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit\\nwhich was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of the\\nCadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightily\\ndid I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I bid you be\\ninstant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tired out, or you\\nare afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no\\ntrue son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus.\"\\n\\nDiomed answered, \"I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove,\\nand will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of heart, nor\\nis there any slackness in me. I am only following your own\\ninstructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but if\\nJove\\'s daughter Venus came into battle I was to wound her with my\\nspear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather\\nin this place, for I know that Mars is now lording it in the field.\"\\n\\n\"Diomed, son of Tydeus,\" replied Minerva, \"man after my own heart, fear\\nneither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will befriend you.\\nNay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close combat; fear not\\nthis raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then on\\nthe other. But now he was holding talk with Juno and myself, saying he\\nwould help the Argives and attack the Trojans; nevertheless he is with\\nthe Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives.\"\\n\\nWith this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the chariot\\non to the ground. In a second he was on the ground, whereupon the\\ngoddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side of Diomed. The\\noaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess and the\\nhero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins, and drove straight at\\nMars. He was in the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesius and\\nbravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Mars was stripping him of his armour,\\nand Minerva donned the helmet of Hades, that he might not see her;\\nwhen, therefore, he saw Diomed, he made straight for him and let\\nPeriphas lie where he had fallen. As soon as they were at close\\nquarters he let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and yoke,\\nthinking to take Diomed\\'s life, but Minerva caught the spear in her\\nhand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed then threw,\\nand Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars\\'s stomach where\\nhis under-girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him, tearing his\\nfair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars roared as loudly\\nas nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans\\nand Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry he raised.\\n\\nAs a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even so\\ndid Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens. With\\nall speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great pain\\nsat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the immortal\\nblood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying,\\n\"Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods are\\ncontinually suffering in the most cruel manner at one another\\'s hands\\nwhile helping mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten\\nthat mad termagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage of\\nsome kind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her you neither\\nscold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent creature is\\nyour daughter. See how she has been inciting proud Diomed to vent his\\nrage on the immortal gods. First he went up to the Cyprian and wounded\\nher in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me too as\\nthough he were a god. Had I not run for it I must either have lain\\nthere for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpses, or have\\nbeen eaten alive with spears till I had no more strength left in me.\"\\n\\nJove looked angrily at him and said, \"Do not come whining here, Sir\\nFacing-both-ways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus, for you\\nare ever fighting and making mischief. You have the intolerable and\\nstubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can do to manage her,\\nand it is her doing that you are now in this plight: still, I cannot\\nlet you remain longer in such great pain; you are my own offspring, and\\nit was by me that your mother conceived you; if, however, you had been\\nthe son of any other god, you are so destructive that by this time you\\nshould have been lying lower than the Titans.\"\\n\\nHe then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing herbs\\nupon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As the\\njuice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment though\\nit is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars. Then Hebe\\nwashed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his seat by\\nhis father Jove all glorious to behold.\\n\\nBut Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put a\\nstop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house of\\nJove.',\n",
       " 'Book XXIV\\n\\nTHE GHOSTS OF THE SUITORS IN HADES--ULYSSES AND HIS MEN GO TO THE HOUSE\\nOF LAERTES--THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA COME OUT TO ATTACK ULYSSES, BUT MINERVA\\nCONCLUDES A PEACE.\\n\\nThen Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his\\nhand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men\\'s eyes in\\nsleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts\\nand led them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind him. As\\nbats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when one of them\\nhas fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even so did the ghosts\\nwhine and squeal as Mercury the healer of sorrow led them down into the\\ndark abode of death. When they had passed the waters of Oceanus and the\\nrock Leucas, they came to the gates of the sun and the land of dreams,\\nwhereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell the souls and\\nshadows of them that can labour no more.\\n\\nHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of\\nPatroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man\\nof all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.\\n\\nThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of\\nAgamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also\\nthe ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus;\\nand the ghost of Achilles spoke first.\\n\\n\"Son of Atreus,\" it said, \"we used to say that Jove had loved you better\\nfrom first to last than any other hero, for you were captain over many\\nand brave men, when we were all fighting together before Troy; yet the\\nhand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid upon you all too\\nearly. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the hey-day of your\\nrenown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound over your ashes, and\\nyour son would have been heir to your good name, whereas it has now been\\nyour lot to come to a most miserable end.\"\\n\\n\"Happy son of Peleus,\" answered the ghost of Agamemnon, \"for having\\ndied at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the\\nAchaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay in the\\nwhirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now of your\\nchivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should we ever\\nhave left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us. Then, when we\\nhad borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid you on your bed and\\ncleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments. The Danaans\\ntore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother, when she\\nheard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and the sound\\nof a great wailing went forth over the waters so that the Achaeans\\nquaked for fear. They would have fled panic-stricken to their ships had\\nnot wise old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest checked them saying,\\n\\'Hold, Argives, fly not sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming\\nfrom the sea with her immortal nymphs to view the body of her son.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of the\\nold man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed you\\nin immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet\\nvoices in lament--calling and answering one another; there was not an\\nArgive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights\\nseven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on the\\neighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep with many\\nan ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in raiment of\\nthe gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes, horse and foot,\\nclashed their armour round the pile as you were burning, with the tramp\\nas of a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven had done\\ntheir work, we gathered your white bones at daybreak and laid them in\\nointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a golden vase to hold\\nthem--gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan himself; in this we mingled\\nyour bleached bones with those of Patroclus who had gone before you, and\\nseparate we enclosed also those of Antilochus, who had been closer to\\nyou than any other of your comrades now that Patroclus was no more.\\n\\n\"Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point\\njutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far\\nout upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born\\nhereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them\\nto be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have\\nbeen present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird\\nthemselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some\\ngreat chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis\\noffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death\\nyour fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore\\namong all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my\\nfighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction on my return, by the\\nhands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with the\\nghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of\\nAgamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up\\nto them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognised Amphimedon son of\\nMelaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, so it began to talk\\nto him.\\n\\n\"Amphimedon,\" it said, \"what has happened to all you fine young men--all\\nof an age too--that you are come down here under the ground? One could\\npick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds and\\nwaves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end\\nof you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing,\\nor while fighting in defence of their wives and city? Answer my\\nquestion, for I have been your guest. Do you not remember how I came to\\nyour house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to join us with his ships\\nagainst Troy? It was a whole month ere we could resume our voyage, for\\nwe had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come with us.\"\\n\\nAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, \"Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of\\nmen, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you fully\\nand accurately about the way in which our end was brought about. Ulysses\\nhad been long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did not say point\\nblank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, for she\\nmeant to compass our destruction: this, then, was the trick she played\\nus. She set up a great tambour frame in her room and began to work on an\\nenormous piece of fine needlework. \\'Sweethearts,\\' said she, \\'Ulysses\\nis indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately;\\nwait--for I would not have my skill in needlework perish\\nunrecorded--till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes, against\\nthe time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of\\nthe place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.\\' This is what she\\nsaid, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon her great\\nweb all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches again\\nby torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years without our\\nfinding it out, but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth year,\\nin the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished, one of her\\nmaids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in the act\\nof undoing her work, so she had to finish it whether she would or no;\\nand when she showed us the robe she had made, after she had had it\\nwashed, {186} its splendour was as that of the sun or moon.\\n\\n\"Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his\\nswineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from\\na voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched\\ntheir plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and then after\\nhim, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and\\nleaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He came\\nso unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among\\nus, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being\\nstruck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but\\nwhen the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and Telemachus\\ntook the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors behind\\nthem. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity\\nof iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this was the\\nbeginning of our end, for not one of us could string the bow--nor nearly\\ndo so. When it was about to reach the hands of Ulysses, we all of us\\nshouted out that it should not be given him, no matter what he might\\nsay, but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When he had got it in his\\nhands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow through the iron. Then\\nhe stood on the floor of the cloister and poured his arrows on the\\nground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed Antinous, and then,\\naiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they fell\\nthick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was\\nhelping them, for they fell upon us with might and main throughout the\\ncloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as our brains\\nwere being battered in, and the ground seethed with our blood. This,\\nAgamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are lying still\\nuncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends at home do not\\nyet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out and wash\\nthe black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to the\\noffices due to the departed.\"\\n\\n\"Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,\" replied the ghost of Agamemnon, \"you\\nare indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare\\nexcellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as\\nPenelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue\\nshall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be\\nwelcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope. How far\\notherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus who killed her\\nlawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men, for she has brought\\ndisgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the bowels\\nof the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the town\\nand soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which he\\nhad reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with a lean-to\\nrunning all round it, where the slaves who worked for him slept and sat\\nand ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel woman, who looked\\nafter him in this his country-farm. When Ulysses got there, he said to\\nhis son and to the other two:\\n\\n\"Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner.\\nMeanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to\\nrecognise me after so long an absence.\"\\n\\nHe then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius, who\\nwent straight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard to\\nmake trial of his father. As he went down into the great orchard, he did\\nnot see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for they\\nwere all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the place\\nwhere the old man had told them; he therefore found his father alone,\\nhoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very shabby;\\nhis legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him from the\\nbrambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat skin cap on\\nhis head, and was looking very woe-begone. When Ulysses saw him so worn,\\nso old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall pear tree and\\nbegan to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him\\nall about his having come home, or whether he should first question him\\nand see what he would say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty\\nwith him, so in this mind he went up to his father, who was bending down\\nand digging about a plant.\\n\\n\"I see, sir,\" said Ulysses, \"that you are an excellent gardener--what\\npains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not a\\nfig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of your\\nattention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended if I say\\nthat you take better care of your garden than of yourself. You are old,\\nunsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle that\\nyour master takes such poor care of you, indeed your face and figure\\nhave nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble birth.\\nI should have said that you were one of those who should wash well, eat\\nwell, and lie soft at night as old men have a right to do; but tell me,\\nand tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose garden are you\\nworking? Tell me also about another matter. Is this place that I have\\ncome to really Ithaca? I met a man just now who said so, but he was a\\ndull fellow, and had not the patience to hear my story out when I was\\nasking him about an old friend of mine, whether he was still living, or\\nwas already dead and in the house of Hades. Believe me when I tell you\\nthat this man came to my house once when I was in my own country and\\nnever yet did any stranger come to me whom I liked better. He said that\\nhis family came from Ithaca and that his father was Laertes, son of\\nArceisius. I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all the\\nabundance of my house, and when he went away I gave him all customary\\npresents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid\\nsilver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks,\\nand as many pieces of tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single\\nfold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts.\\nTo all this I added four good looking women skilled in all useful arts,\\nand I let him take his choice.\"\\n\\nHis father shed tears and answered, \"Sir, you have indeed come to the\\ncountry that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of wicked\\npeople. All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose. If\\nyou could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would have\\nentertained you hospitably and would have requited your presents amply\\nwhen you left him--as would have been only right considering what you\\nhad already given him. But tell me, and tell me true, how many years is\\nit since you entertained this guest--my unhappy son, as ever was? Alas!\\nHe has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea have\\neaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some\\ncontinent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents,\\ncould throw our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could\\nhis excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as was\\nnatural upon his death bed, and close his eyes according to the offices\\ndue to the departed. But now, tell me truly for I want to know. Who\\nand whence are you--tell me of your town and parents? Where is the\\nship lying that has brought you and your men to Ithaca? Or were you a\\npassenger on some other man\\'s ship, and those who brought you here have\\ngone on their way and left you?\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you everything,\" answered Ulysses, \"quite truly. I come\\nfrom Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who\\nis the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off my\\ncourse as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here against\\nmy will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the open country\\noutside the town, and this is the fifth year since Ulysses left my\\ncountry. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for him when he left me.\\nThe birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced to\\nsee them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have another\\nfriendly meeting and exchange presents.\"\\n\\nA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both\\nhands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey\\nhead, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched,\\nand his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang\\ntowards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying, \"I am he,\\nfather, about whom you are asking--I have returned after having been\\naway for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation--we have\\nno time to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing the\\nsuitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes.\"\\n\\n\"If you really are my son Ulysses,\" replied Laertes, \"and have come back\\nagain, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity as shall\\nconvince me.\"\\n\\n\"First observe this scar,\" answered Ulysses, \"which I got from a boar\\'s\\ntusk when I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me\\nto Autolycus, my mother\\'s father, to receive the presents which when he\\nwas over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point out\\nto you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all\\nabout them as I followed you round the garden. We went over them all,\\nand you told me their names and what they all were. You gave me thirteen\\npear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig trees; you also said you\\nwould give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn planted between each\\nrow, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of heaven has\\nbeen laid heavy upon them.\"\\n\\nLaertes\\' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which\\nhis son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to\\nsupport him, or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he\\ncame to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, \"O father\\nJove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the suitors have\\nreally been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless, I\\nam much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up here\\ndirectly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the\\ncities of the Cephallenians.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that,\\nbut let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told\\nTelemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready\\nas soon as possible.\"\\n\\nThus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they got\\nthere they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting\\nup meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took\\nLaertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on\\na good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and gave him a more imposing\\npresence, making him taller and stouter than before. When he came back\\nhis son was surprised to see him looking so like an immortal, and said\\nto him, \"My dear father, some one of the gods has been making you much\\ntaller and better-looking.\"\\n\\nLaertes answered, \"Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that\\nI were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took\\nNericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I\\nthen was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on, I should\\nhave been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors. I\\nshould have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced to\\nsee it.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their\\nwork and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his proper\\nplace on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and by old\\nDolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their mother, the\\nSicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was growing old, had\\nbeen to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were certain it was he,\\nthey stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses scolded them good\\nnaturedly and said, \"Sit down to your dinner, old man, and never mind\\nabout your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for some time and\\nhave been waiting for you.\"\\n\\nThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. \"Sir,\" said\\nhe, seizing his master\\'s hand and kissing it at the wrist, \"we have long\\nbeen wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after we\\nhad given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper you.\\n{187} But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or shall\\nwe send some one to tell her?\"\\n\\n\"Old man,\" answered Ulysses, \"she knows already, so you need not trouble\\nabout that.\" On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius gathered\\nround Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one after the other;\\nthen they took their seats in due order near Dolius their father.\\n\\nWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round\\nthe town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the\\nsuitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered\\nfrom every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses.\\nThey took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies\\nof those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the\\nfishermen to take each of them to his own place. They then met angrily\\nin the place of assembly, and when they were got together Eupeithes\\nrose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death of his son\\nAntinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses, so he said,\\nweeping bitterly, \"My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great\\nwrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he\\nhas lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been\\nkilling all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and\\ndoing before he can get away to Pylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule,\\nor we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an\\neverlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder of our sons\\nand brothers. For my own part I should have no more pleasure in life,\\nbut had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after them, before\\nthey can cross over to the main land.\"\\n\\nHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard\\nPhemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses.\\nEvery one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle of\\nthe assembly, and Medon said, \"Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did not\\ndo these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an immortal god\\ntake the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god appeared, now in\\nfront of him encouraging him, and now going furiously about the court\\nand attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on one another.\"\\n\\nOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor,\\nrose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both past and\\nfuture; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,\\n\\n\"Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as\\nthey have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we\\nbade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the\\nwantonness of their hearts--wasting the substance and dishonouring the\\nwife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however, let\\nit be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against Ulysses, or\\nyou may find that you have been drawing down evil on your own heads.\"\\n\\nThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at\\nonce left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the\\nspeech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes;\\nthey therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed\\nthemselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes led\\nthem on in their folly. He thought he was going to avenge the murder\\nof his son, whereas in truth he was never to return, but was himself to\\nperish in his attempt.\\n\\nThen Minerva said to Jove, \"Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, answer\\nme this question--What do you propose to do? Will you set them fighting\\nstill further, or will you make peace between them?\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your\\nown arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the\\nsuitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will\\nbe most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them\\nswear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue to\\nrule, while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre of\\ntheir sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as heretofore,\\nand let peace and plenty reign.\"\\n\\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she\\ndarted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.\\n\\nNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by\\nsaying, \"Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close up\\nto us.\" So one of Dolius\\'s sons went as he was bid. Standing on the\\nthreshold he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses, \"Here\\nthey are, let us put on our armour at once.\"\\n\\nThey put on their armour as fast as they could--that is to say Ulysses,\\nhis three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius did\\nthe same--warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they\\nhad all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth,\\nUlysses leading the way.\\n\\nThen Jove\\'s daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form\\nand voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to\\nhis son Telemachus, \"Telemachus, now that you are about to fight in an\\nengagement, which will show every man\\'s mettle, be sure not to disgrace\\nyour ancestors, who were eminent for their strength and courage all the\\nworld over.\"\\n\\n\"You say truly, my dear father,\" answered Telemachus, \"and you shall\\nsee, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.\"\\n\\nLaertes was delighted when he heard this. \"Good heavens,\" he exclaimed,\\n\"what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and\\ngrandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour.\"\\n\\nOn this Minerva came close up to him and said, \"Son of Arceisius---best\\nfriend I have in the world--pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and to Jove\\nher father; then poise your spear and hurl it.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed\\nto her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes\\' helmet, and\\nthe spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and\\nhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\\nMeantime Ulysses and his son fell upon the front line of the foe and\\nsmote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed\\nevery one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again,\\nonly Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. \"Men of\\nIthaca,\" she cried, \"cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter at\\nonce without further bloodshed.\"\\n\\nOn this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their\\narms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of\\nthe goddess\\' voice, and they fled back to the city for their lives. But\\nUlysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped down\\nlike a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire\\nthat fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to Ulysses, \"Ulysses,\\nnoble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will be angry\\nwith you.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed\\nthe form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace\\nbetween the two contending parties.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XI\\n\\n  In the forenoon the fight is equal, but Agamemnon turns the\\n  fortune of the day towards the Achaeans until he gets\\n  wounded and leaves the field--Hector then drives everything\\n  before him till he is wounded by Diomed--Paris wounds\\n  Diomed--Ulysses, Nestor, and Idomeneus perform prodigies\\n  of valour--Machaon is wounded--Nestor drives him off in\\n  his chariot--Achilles sees the pair driving towards the camp\\n  and sends Patroclus to ask who it is that is wounded--This\\n  is the beginning of evil for Patroclus--Nestor makes a long\\n  speech.\\n\\nAND now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of light\\nalike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord with the\\nensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans. She took her\\nstand by the huge black hull of Ulysses\\' ship which was middlemost of\\nall, so that her voice might carry farthest on either side, on the one\\nhand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other towards\\nthose of Achilles--for these two heroes, well-assured of their own\\nstrength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the two ends of the\\nline. There she took her stand, and raised a cry both loud and shrill\\nthat filled the Achaeans with courage, giving them heart to fight\\nresolutely and with all their might, so that they had rather stay there\\nand do battle than go home in their ships.\\n\\nThe son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselves\\nfor battle while he put on his armour. First he girded his goodly\\ngreaves about his legs, making them fast with ankle-clasps of silver;\\nand about his chest he set the breastplate which Cinyras had once given\\nhim as a guest-gift. It had been noised abroad as far as Cyprus that\\nthe Achaeans were about to sail for Troy, and therefore he gave it to\\nthe king. It had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve of gold, and ten of\\ntin. There were serpents of cyanus that reared themselves up towards\\nthe neck, three upon either side, like the rainbows which the son of\\nSaturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortal men. About his shoulders\\nhe threw his sword, studded with bosses of gold; and the scabbard was\\nof silver with a chain of gold wherewith to hang it. He took moreover\\nthe richly-dight shield that covered his body when he was in\\nbattle--fair to see, with ten circles of bronze running all round it.\\nOn the body of the shield there were twenty bosses of white tin, with\\nanother of dark cyanus in the middle: this last was made to show a\\nGorgon\\'s head, fierce and grim, with Rout and Panic on either side. The\\nband for the arm to go through was of silver, on which there was a\\nwrithing snake of cyanus with three heads that sprang from a single\\nneck, and went in and out among one another. On his head Agamemnon set\\na helmet, with a peak before and behind, and four plumes of horse-hair\\nthat nodded menacingly above it; then he grasped two redoubtable\\nbronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his armour shot from him as a\\nflame into the firmament, while Juno and Minerva thundered in honour of\\nthe king of rich Mycene.\\n\\nEvery man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold them\\nin readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on foot clad in\\nfull armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into the dawning. The\\nchiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses got there, but\\nthese came up presently. The son of Saturn sent a portent of evil sound\\nabout their host, and the dew fell red with blood, for he was about to\\nsend many a brave man hurrying down to Hades.\\n\\nThe Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain, were\\ngathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas who was honoured\\nby the Trojans like an immortal, and the three sons of Antenor,\\nPolybus, Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a god. Hector\\'s round\\nshield showed in the front rank, and as some baneful star that shines\\nfor a moment through a rent in the clouds and is again hidden beneath\\nthem; even so was Hector now seen in the front ranks and now again in\\nthe hindermost, and his bronze armour gleamed like the lightning of\\naegis-bearing Jove.\\n\\nAnd now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon a rich\\nman\\'s land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even so did the\\nTrojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no mood for\\nyielding but fought like wolves, and neither side got the better of the\\nother. Discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was the only god\\nthat went among them; the others were not there, but stayed quietly\\neach in his own home among the dells and valleys of Olympus. All of\\nthem blamed the son of Saturn for wanting to give victory to the\\nTrojans, but father Jove heeded them not: he held aloof from all, and\\nsat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon the city of\\nthe Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam of bronze, and alike\\nupon the slayers and on the slain.\\n\\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their darts\\nrained thick on one another and the people perished, but as the hour\\ndrew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will get his\\nmidday meal--for he has felled till his hands are weary; he is tired\\nout, and must now have food--then the Danaans with a cry that rang\\nthrough all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy. Agamemnon\\nled them on, and slew first Bienor, a leader of his people, and\\nafterwards his comrade and charioteer Oileus, who sprang from his\\nchariot and was coming full towards him; but Agamemnon struck him on\\nthe forehead with his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail against\\nthe weapon, which pierced both bronze and bone, so that his brains were\\nbattered in and he was killed in full fight.\\n\\nAgamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with their\\nbreasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went on to kill\\nIsus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, the other born\\nin wedlock; they were in the same chariot--the bastard driving, while\\nnoble Antiphus fought beside him. Achilles had once taken both of them\\nprisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound them with fresh withes as\\nthey were shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them; now,\\nhowever, Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus in the chest above the\\nnipple with his spear, while he struck Antiphus hard by the ear and\\nthrew him from his chariot. Forthwith he stripped their goodly armour\\nfrom off them and recognized them, for he had already seen them at\\nships when Achilles brought them in from Ida. As a lion fastens on the\\nfawns of a hind and crushes them in his great jaws, robbing them of\\ntheir tender life while he on his way back to his lair--the hind can do\\nnothing for them even though she be close by, for she is in an agony of\\nfear, and flies through the thick forest, sweating, and at her utmost\\nspeed before the mighty monster--so, no man of the Trojans could help\\nIsus and Antiphus, for they were themselves flying in panic before the\\nArgives.\\n\\nThen King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and brave\\nHippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost in preventing\\nHelen\\'s being restored to Menelaus, for he was largely bribed by\\nAlexandrus; and now Agamemnon took his two sons, both in the same\\nchariot, trying to bring their horses to a stand--for they had lost\\nhold of the reins and the horses were mad with fear. The son of Atreus\\nsprang upon them like a lion, and the pair besought him from their\\nchariot. \"Take us alive,\" they cried, \"son of Atreus, and you shall\\nreceive a great ransom for us. Our father Antimachus has great store of\\ngold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this he will satisfy you with\\na very large ransom should he hear of our being alive at the ships of\\nthe Achaeans.\"\\n\\nWith such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but they\\nheard no pitiful answer in return. \"If,\" said Agamemnon, \"you are sons\\nof Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans proposed that Menelaus\\nand Ulysses, who had come to you as envoys, should be killed and not\\nsuffered to return, you shall now pay for the foul iniquity of your\\nfather.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth, smiting\\nhim on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermost upon the\\nground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; he cut off\\nhis hands and his head--which he sent rolling in among the crowd as\\nthough it were a ball. There he let them both lie, and wherever the\\nranks were thickest thither he flew, while the other Achaeans followed.\\nFoot soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe in rout before them,\\nand slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen, and the thundering\\ntramp of the horses raised a cloud of dust from off the plain. King\\nAgamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and cheering on the\\nAchaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze--the eddying gusts\\nwhirl fire in all directions till the thickets shrivel and are consumed\\nbefore the blast of the flame--even so fell the heads of the flying\\nTrojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, and many a noble pair of steeds\\ndrew an empty chariot along the highways of war, for lack of drivers\\nwho were lying on the plain, more useful now to vultures than to their\\nwives.\\n\\nJove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage and din\\nof battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling out lustily to\\nthe Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus, son of Dardanus, in\\nthe middle of the plain, and past the place of the wild fig-tree making\\nalways for the city--the son of Atreus still shouting, and with hands\\nall bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached the Scaean gates and\\nthe oak tree, there they halted and waited for the others to come up.\\nMeanwhile the Trojans kept on flying over the middle of the plain like\\na herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them in\\nthe dead of night--he springs on one of them, seizes her neck in the\\ngrip of his strong teeth and then laps up her blood and gorges himself\\nupon her entrails--even so did King Agamemnon son of Atreus pursue the\\nfoe, ever slaughtering the hindmost as they fled pell-mell before him.\\nMany a man was flung headlong from his chariot by the hand of the son\\nof Atreus, for he wielded his spear with fury.\\n\\nBut when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city, the\\nfather of gods and men came down from heaven and took his seat,\\nthunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida. He then\\ntold Iris of the golden wings to carry a message for him. \"Go,\" said\\nhe, \"fleet Iris, and speak thus to Hector--say that so long as he sees\\nAgamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, he is\\nto keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle, but when\\nAgamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to his\\nchariot, then will I vouchsafe him strength to slay till he reach the\\nships and night falls at the going down of the sun.\"\\n\\nIris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from the\\ncrests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his chariot\\nand horses. Then she said, \"Hector son of Priam, peer of gods in\\ncounsel, father Jove has sent me to bear you this message--so long as\\nyou see Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks,\\nyou are to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle,\\nbut when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to\\nhis chariot, then will Jove vouchsafe you strength to slay till you\\nreach the ships, and till night falls at the going down of the sun.\"\\n\\nWhen she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full armed\\nfrom his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he went about\\neverywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, and stirring\\nthe dread strife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round, and again\\nmet the Achaeans, while the Argives on their part strengthened their\\nbattalions. The battle was now in array and they stood face to face\\nwith one another, Agamemnon ever pressing forward in his eagerness to\\nbe ahead of all others.\\n\\nTell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who,\\nwhether of the Trojans or of their allies, was first to face Agamemnon?\\nIt was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and of great stature,\\nwho was brought up in fertile Thrace, the mother of sheep. Cisses, his\\nmother\\'s father, brought him up in his own house when he was a\\nchild--Cisses, father to fair Theano. When he reached manhood, Cisses\\nwould have kept him there, and was for giving him his daughter in\\nmarriage, but as soon as he had married he set out to fight the\\nAchaeans with twelve ships that followed him: these he had left at\\nPercote and had come on by land to Ilius. He it was that now met\\nAgamemnon son of Atreus. When they were close up with one another, the\\nson of Atreus missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him on the girdle below\\nthe cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting to his strength\\nof arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor nearly so, for the\\npoint of the spear struck against the silver and was turned aside as\\nthough it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught it from his hand, and\\ndrew it towards him with the fury of a lion; he then drew his sword,\\nand killed Iphidamas by striking him on the neck. So there the poor\\nfellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were of bronze, killed in the\\ndefence of his fellow-citizens, far from his wedded wife, of whom he\\nhad had no joy though he had given much for her: he had given a\\nhundred-head of cattle down, and had promised later on to give a\\nthousand sheep and goats mixed, from the countless flocks of which he\\nwas possessed. Agamemnon son of Atreus then despoiled him, and carried\\noff his armour into the host of the Achaeans.\\n\\nWhen noble Coon, Antenor\\'s eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were his\\neyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon he got\\nbeside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of his arm\\nbelow the elbow, the point of the spear going right through the arm.\\nAgamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not even for this did he\\nleave off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear that flew as\\nfleet as the wind, and sprang upon Coon who was trying to drag off the\\nbody of his brother--his father\\'s son--by the foot, and was crying for\\nhelp to all the bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnon struck him with\\na bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was dragging the dead body\\nthrough the press of men under cover of his shield: he then cut off his\\nhead, standing over the body of Iphidamas. Thus did the sons of Antenor\\nmeet their fate at the hands of the son of Atreus, and go down into the\\nhouse of Hades.\\n\\nAs long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon went\\nabout attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword and with\\ngreat handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and the\\nwound grew dry, the pain became great. As the sharp pangs which the\\nEilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth, daughters of Juno and dispensers\\nof cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labour--even so sharp\\nwere the pangs of the son of Atreus. He sprang on to his chariot, and\\nbade his charioteer drive to the ships, for he was in great agony. With\\na loud clear voice he shouted to the Danaans, \"My friends, princes and\\ncounsellors of the Argives, defend the ships yourselves, for Jove has\\nnot suffered me to fight the whole day through against the Trojans.\"\\n\\nWith this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and they\\nflew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foam and their\\nbellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of the battle.\\n\\nWhen Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the Trojans and\\nLycians saying, \"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian warriors, be men, my\\nfriends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; their best man has\\nleft them, and Jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph; charge the foe\\nwith your chariots that you may win still greater glory.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a huntsman\\nhounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so did Hector,\\npeer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the Achaeans. Full of\\nhope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fight like some\\nfierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes its deep blue\\nwaters into fury.\\n\\nWhat, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killed in\\nthe hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him? First Asaeus,\\nAutonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius, Opheltius and Agelaus;\\nAesymnus, Orus and Hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftains of\\nthe Achaeans did Hector slay, and then he fell upon the rank and file.\\nAs when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white south and beats\\nthem down with the fierceness of its fury--the waves of the sea roll\\nhigh, and the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the wandering\\nwind--even so thick were the heads of them that fell by the hand of\\nHector.\\n\\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would have\\nfled pell-mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out to Diomed,\\n\"Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forget our\\nprowess? Come, my good fellow, stand by my side and help me, we shall\\nbe shamed for ever if Hector takes the ships.\"\\n\\nAnd Diomed answered, \"Come what may, I will stand firm; but we shall\\nhave scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to the Trojans\\nrather than to us.\"\\n\\nWith these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to the ground,\\nsmiting him in the left breast with his spear, while Ulysses killed\\nMolion who was his squire. These they let lie, now that they had\\nstopped their fighting; the two heroes then went on playing havoc with\\nthe foe, like two wild boars that turn in fury and rend the hounds that\\nhunt them. Thus did they turn upon the Trojans and slay them, and the\\nAchaeans were thankful to have breathing time in their flight from\\nHector.\\n\\nThey then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of Merops\\nof Percote, who excelled all others in the arts of divination. He had\\nforbidden his sons to go to the war, but they would not obey him, for\\nfate lured them to their fall. Diomed son of Tydeus slew them both and\\nstripped them of their armour, while Ulysses killed Hippodamus and\\nHypeirochus.\\n\\nAnd now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained that\\nneither side should have the advantage, and they kept on killing one\\nanother. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of Paeon in the\\nhip-joint with his spear. His chariot was not at hand for him to fly\\nwith, so blindly confident had he been. His squire was in charge of it\\nat some distance and he was fighting on foot among the foremost until\\nhe lost his life. Hector soon marked the havoc Diomed and Ulysses were\\nmaking, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followed by the Trojan\\nranks; brave Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and said to Ulysses\\nwho was beside him, \"Great Hector is bearing down upon us and we shall\\nbe undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss his\\nmark. He had aimed at Hector\\'s head near the top of his helmet, but\\nbronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was untouched, for the spear\\nwas stayed by the visored helm made with three plates of metal, which\\nPhoebus Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a great bound\\nunder cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and propped himself with\\nhis brawny hand leaning on the ground, for darkness had fallen on his\\neyes. The son of Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among the\\nforemost fighters, to the place where he had seen it strike the ground;\\nmeanwhile Hector recovered himself and springing back into his chariot\\nmingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life. But Diomed\\nmade at him with his spear and said, \"Dog, you have again got away\\nthough death was close on your heels. Phoebus Apollo, to whom I ween\\nyou pray ere you go into battle, has again saved you, nevertheless I\\nwill meet you and make an end of you hereafter, if there is any god who\\nwill stand by me too and be my helper. For the present I must pursue\\nthose I can lay hands on.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, but\\nAlexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him, leaning\\nagainst a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son of\\nDardanus, a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken the cuirass from off\\nthe breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and the shield from\\noff his shoulders, when Paris drew his bow and let fly an arrow that\\nsped not from his hand in vain, but pierced the flat of Diomed\\'s right\\nfoot, going right through it and fixing itself in the ground. Thereon\\nParis with a hearty laugh sprang forward from his hiding-place, and\\ntaunted him saying, \"You are wounded--my arrow has not been shot in\\nvain; would that it had hit you in the belly and killed you, for thus\\nthe Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion, would have had a truce\\nfrom evil.\"\\n\\nDiomed all undaunted answered, \"Archer, you who without your bow are\\nnothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in single\\ncombat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serve\\nyou in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched the\\nsole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy had\\nhit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when I wound\\na man though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for my weapon\\nwill lay him low. His wife will tear her cheeks for grief and his\\nchildren will be fatherless: there will he rot, reddening the earth\\nwith his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round him.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under this cover\\nhe sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was the pain he\\nsuffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his chariot and bade the\\ncharioteer drive him to the ships, for he was sick at heart.\\n\\nUlysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for they\\nwere all panic-stricken. \"Alas,\" said he to himself in his dismay,\\n\"what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly before these odds,\\nbut it will be worse if I am left alone and taken prisoner, for the son\\nof Saturn has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic. But why talk\\nto myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowards quit the\\nfield, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must stand firm and hold\\nhis own.\"\\n\\nWhile he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced and\\nhemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to rue it. As hounds and\\nlusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lair whetting\\nhis white tusks--they attack him from every side and can hear the\\ngnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still hold their\\nground--even so furiously did the Trojans attack Ulysses. First he\\nsprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and wounded him on the shoulder\\nwith a downward blow; then he killed Thoon and Ennomus. After these he\\nstruck Chersidamas in the loins under his shield as he had just sprung\\ndown from his chariot; so he fell in the dust and clutched the earth in\\nthe hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and went on to wound Charops\\nson of Hippasus own brother to noble Socus. Socus, hero that he was,\\nmade all speed to help him, and when he was close to Ulysses he said,\\n\"Far-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil, this day you shall\\neither boast of having killed both the sons of Hippasus and stripped\\nthem of their armour, or you shall fall before my spear.\"\\n\\nWith these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear went\\nthrough the shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass,\\ntearing the flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did not suffer it\\nto pierce the entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew that his hour was not\\nyet come, but he gave ground and said to Socus, \"Wretch, you shall now\\nsurely die. You have stayed me from fighting further with the Trojans,\\nbut you shall now fall by my spear, yielding glory to myself, and your\\nsoul to Hades of the noble steeds.\"\\n\\nSocus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck him in\\nthe back midway between the shoulders, and went right through his\\nchest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses vaunted over him\\nsaying, \"O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of horses, death has been too\\nquick for you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, not even in\\ndeath shall your father and mother close your eyes, but the ravening\\nvultures shall enshroud you with the flapping of their dark wings and\\ndevour you. Whereas even though I fall the Achaeans will give me my due\\nrites of burial.\"\\n\\nSo saying he drew Socus\\'s heavy spear out of his flesh and from his\\nshield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn so that\\nhe was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Ulysses was bleeding\\nthey raised a great shout and came on in a body towards him; he\\ntherefore gave ground, and called his comrades to come and help him.\\nThrice did he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice did brave\\nMenelaus hear him; he turned, therefore, to Ajax who was close beside\\nhim and said, \"Ajax, noble son of Telamon, captain of your people, the\\ncry of Ulysses rings in my ears, as though the Trojans had cut him off\\nand were worsting him while he is single-handed. Let us make our way\\nthrough the throng; it will be well that we defend him; I fear he may\\ncome to harm for all his valour if he be left without support, and the\\nDanaans would miss him sorely.\"\\n\\nHe led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had gathered\\nround Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the carcase of some\\nhorned stag that has been hit with an arrow--the stag has fled at full\\nspeed so long as his blood was warm and his strength has lasted, but\\nwhen the arrow has overcome him, the savage jackals devour him in the\\nshady glades of the forest. Then heaven sends a fierce lion thither,\\nwhereon the jackals fly in terror and the lion robs them of their\\nprey--even so did Trojans many and brave gather round crafty Ulysses,\\nbut the hero stood at bay and kept them off with his spear. Ajax then\\ncame up with his shield before him like a wall, and stood hard by,\\nwhereon the Trojans fled in all directions. Menelaus took Ulysses by\\nthe hand, and led him out of the press while his squire brought up his\\nchariot, but Ajax rushed furiously on the Trojans and killed Doryclus,\\na bastard son of Priam; then he wounded Pandocus, Lysandrus, Pyrasus,\\nand Pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes rushing in full flood from\\nthe mountains on to the plain, big with the rain of heaven--many a dry\\noak and many a pine does it engulf, and much mud does it bring down and\\ncast into the sea--even so did brave Ajax chase the foe furiously over\\nthe plain, slaying both men and horses.\\n\\nHector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting on the\\nextreme left of the battle by the banks of the river Scamander, where\\nthe carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round Nestor and brave\\nIdomeneus. Among these Hector was making great slaughter with his spear\\nand furious driving, and was destroying the ranks that were opposed to\\nhim; still the Achaeans would have given no ground, had not Alexandrus\\nhusband of lovely Helen stayed the prowess of Machaon, shepherd of his\\npeople, by wounding him in the right shoulder with a triple-barbed\\narrow. The Achaeans were in great fear that as the fight had turned\\nagainst them the Trojans might take him prisoner, and Idomeneus said to\\nNestor, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, mount your\\nchariot at once; take Machaon with you and drive your horses to the\\nships as fast as you can. A physician is worth more than several other\\nmen put together, for he can cut out arrows and spread healing herbs.\"\\n\\nNestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he at once\\nmounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physician\\nAesculapius, went with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onward\\nnothing loth towards the ships, as though of their own free will.\\n\\nThen Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector from his\\nplace beside him, \"Hector, here are we two fighting on the extreme wing\\nof the battle, while the other Trojans are in pell-mell rout, they and\\ntheir horses. Ajax son of Telamon is driving them before him; I know\\nhim by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot and horses\\nthither, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately, and where\\nthe cry of battle is loudest.\"\\n\\nWith this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whip they\\ndrew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and Trojans, over the\\nbodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle was bespattered\\nwith blood, and the rail round the car was covered with splashes both\\nfrom the horses\\' hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels. Hector tore\\nhis way through and flung himself into the thick of the fight, and his\\npresence threw the Danaans into confusion, for his spear was not long\\nidle; nevertheless though he went among the ranks with sword and spear,\\nand throwing great stones, he avoided Ajax son of Telamon, for Jove\\nwould have been angry with him if he had fought a better man than\\nhimself.\\n\\nThen father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart of\\nAjax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind\\nhim--looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were some\\nwild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowly\\nbackwards. As peasants with their hounds chase a lion from their\\nstockyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off the pick of\\ntheir herd--he makes his greedy spring, but in vain, for the darts from\\nmany a strong hand fall thick around him, with burning brands that\\nscare him for all his fury, and when morning comes he slinks foiled and\\nangry away--even so did Ajax, sorely against his will, retreat angrily\\nbefore the Trojans, fearing for the ships of the Achaeans. Or as some\\nlazy ass that has had many a cudgel broken about his back, when he into\\na field begins eating the corn--boys beat him but he is too many for\\nthem, and though they lay about with their sticks they cannot hurt him;\\nstill when he has had his fill they at last drive him from the\\nfield--even so did the Trojans and their allies pursue great Ajax, ever\\nsmiting the middle of his shield with their darts. Now and again he\\nwould turn and show fight, keeping back the battalions of the Trojans,\\nand then he would again retreat; but he prevented any of them from\\nmaking his way to the ships. Single-handed he stood midway between the\\nTrojans and Achaeans: the spears that sped from their hands stuck some\\nof them in his mighty shield, while many, though thirsting for his\\nblood, fell to the ground ere they could reach him to the wounding of\\nhis fair flesh.\\n\\nNow when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax was being\\noverpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and hurled his\\nspear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver below the\\nmidriff, and laid him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him, and stripped the\\narmour from his shoulders; but when Alexandrus saw him, he aimed an\\narrow at him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrow broke, but\\nthe point that was left in the wound dragged on the thigh; he drew\\nback, therefore, under cover of his comrades to save his life, shouting\\nas he did so to the Danaans, \"My friends, princes and counsellors of\\nthe Argives, rally to the defence of Ajax who is being overpowered, and\\nI doubt whether he will come out of the fight alive. Hither, then, to\\nthe rescue of great Ajax son of Telamon.\"\\n\\nEven so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came near,\\nand gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from their\\nshoulders so as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards them, and\\nturned round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached his men.\\n\\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the mares\\nof Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor out of the\\nfight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achilles saw and\\ntook note, for he was standing on the stern of his ship watching the\\nhard stress and struggle of the fight. He called from the ship to his\\ncomrade Patroclus, who heard him in the tent and came out looking like\\nMars himself--here indeed was the beginning of the ill that presently\\nbefell him. \"Why,\" said he, \"Achilles, do you call me? What do you want\\nwith me?\" And Achilles answered, \"Noble son of Menoetius, man after my\\nown heart, I take it that I shall now have the Achaeans praying at my\\nknees, for they are in great straits; go, Patroclus, and ask Nestor who\\nit is that he is bearing away wounded from the field; from his back I\\nshould say it was Machaon son of Aesculapius, but I could not see his\\nface for the horses went by me at full speed.\"\\n\\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off running\\nby the ships and tents of the Achaeans.\\n\\nWhen Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son of Neleus,\\nthey dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the horses from the\\nchariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the seaside to dry the\\nsweat from their shirts, and when they had so done they came inside and\\ntook their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom Nestor had had awarded to him\\nfrom Tenedos when Achilles took it, mixed them a mess; she was daughter\\nof wise Arsinous, and the Achaeans had given her to Nestor because he\\nexcelled all of them in counsel. First she set for them a fair and\\nwell-made table that had feet of cyanus; on it there was a vessel of\\nbronze and an onion to give relish to the drink, with honey and cakes\\nof barley-meal. There was also a cup of rare workmanship which the old\\nman had brought with him from home, studded with bosses of gold; it had\\nfour handles, on each of which there were two golden doves feeding, and\\nit had two feet to stand on. Any one else would hardly have been able\\nto lift it from the table when it was full, but Nestor could do so\\nquite easily. In this the woman, as fair as a goddess, mixed them a\\nmess with Pramnian wine; she grated goat\\'s milk cheese into it with a\\nbronze grater, threw in a handful of white barley-meal, and having thus\\nprepared the mess she bade them drink it. When they had done so and had\\nthus quenched their thirst, they fell talking with one another, and at\\nthis moment Patroclus appeared at the door.\\n\\nWhen the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand, led\\nhim into the tent, and bade him take his place among them; but\\nPatroclus stood where he was and said, \"Noble sir, I may not stay, you\\ncannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is not one to be trifled\\nwith, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom you were bearing\\naway from the field. I can now see for myself that he is Machaon,\\nshepherd of his people. I must go back and tell Achilles. You, sir,\\nknow what a terrible man he is, and how ready to blame even where no\\nblame should lie.\"\\n\\nAnd Nestor answered, \"Why should Achilles care to know how many of the\\nAchaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that reigns in our\\nhost; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomed, son of\\nTydeus, is wounded; so are Ulysses and Agamemnon; Eurypylus has been\\nhit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing this man\\nfrom the field--he too wounded with an arrow. Nevertheless, Achilles,\\nso valiant though he be, cares not and knows no ruth. Will he wait till\\nthe ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we perish one upon the\\nother? As for me, I have no strength nor stay in me any longer; would\\nthat I were still young and strong as in the days when there was a\\nfight between us and the men of Elis about some cattle-raiding. I then\\nkilled Itymoneus, the valiant son of Hypeirochus, a dweller in Elis, as\\nI was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown by my hand\\nwhile fighting in the front rank in defence of his cows, so he fell and\\nthe country people around him were in great fear. We drove off a vast\\nquantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds of cattle and as many\\nflocks of sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, and as many wide-spreading\\nflocks of goats. Of horses, moreover, we seized a hundred and fifty,\\nall of them mares, and many had foals running with them. All these did\\nwe drive by night to Pylus, the city of Neleus, taking them within the\\ncity; and the heart of Neleus was glad in that I had taken so much,\\nthough it was the first time I had ever been in the field. At daybreak\\nthe heralds went round crying that all in Elis to whom there was a debt\\nowing should come; and the leading Pylians assembled to divide the\\nspoils. There were many to whom the Epeans owed chattels, for we men of\\nPylus were few and had been oppressed with wrong; in former years\\nHercules had come, and had laid his hand heavy upon us, so that all our\\nbest men had perished. Neleus had had twelve sons, but I alone was\\nleft; the others had all been killed. The Epeans presuming upon all\\nthis had looked down upon us and had done us much evil. My father chose\\na herd of cattle and a great flock of sheep--three hundred in all--and\\nhe took their shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to him\\nin Elis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes. They and their chariots\\nwith them had gone to the games and were to run for a tripod, but King\\nAugeas took them, and sent back their driver grieving for the loss of\\nhis horses. Neleus was angered by what he had both said and done, and\\ntook great value in return, but he divided the rest, that no man might\\nhave less than his full share.\\n\\n\"Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods\\nthroughout the city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in a\\nbody, many in number, they and their chariots, in full array, and with\\nthem the two Moliones in their armour, though they were still lads and\\nunused to fighting. Now there is a certain town, Thryoessa, perched\\nupon a rock on the river Alpheus, the border city of Pylus. This they\\nwould destroy, and pitched their camp about it, but when they had\\ncrossed their whole plain, Minerva darted down by night from Olympus\\nand bade us set ourselves in array; and she found willing soldiers in\\nPylos, for the men meant fighting. Neleus would not let me arm, and hid\\nmy horses, for he said that as yet I could know nothing about war;\\nnevertheless Minerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as I was, I\\nfought among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of them.\\nThere is a river Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene, and there\\nthey that were mounted (and I with them) waited till morning, when the\\ncompanies of foot soldiers came up with us in force. Thence in full\\npanoply and equipment we came towards noon to the sacred waters of the\\nAlpheus, and there we offered victims to almighty Jove, with a bull to\\nAlpheus, another to Neptune, and a herd-heifer to Minerva. After this\\nwe took supper in our companies, and laid us down to rest each in his\\narmour by the river.\\n\\n\"The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to take it,\\nbut ere this might be there was a desperate fight in store for them.\\nWhen the sun\\'s rays began to fall upon the earth we joined battle,\\npraying to Jove and to Minerva, and when the fight had begun, I was the\\nfirst to kill my man and take his horses--to wit the warrior Mulius. He\\nwas son-in-law to Augeas, having married his eldest daughter,\\ngolden-haired Agamede, who knew the virtues of every herb which grows\\nupon the face of the earth. I speared him as he was coming towards me,\\nand when he fell headlong in the dust, I sprang upon his chariot and\\ntook my place in the front ranks. The Epeans fled in all directions\\nwhen they saw the captain of their horsemen (the best man they had)\\nlaid low, and I swept down on them like a whirlwind, taking fifty\\nchariots--and in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my spear.\\nI should have even killed the two Moliones, sons of Actor, unless their\\nreal father, Neptune lord of the earthquake, had hidden them in a thick\\nmist and borne them out of the fight. Thereon Jove vouchsafed the\\nPylians a great victory, for we chased them far over the plain, killing\\nthe men and bringing in their armour, till we had brought our horses to\\nBuprasium, rich in wheat, and to the Olenian rock, with the hill that\\nis called Alision, at which point Minerva turned the people back. There\\nI slew the last man and left him; then the Achaeans drove their horses\\nback from Buprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among the gods,\\nand among mortal men to Nestor.\\n\\n\"Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles is for\\nkeeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue it hereafter\\nwhen the host is being cut to pieces. My good friend, did not Menoetius\\ncharge you thus, on the day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon?\\nUlysses and I were in the house, inside, and heard all that he said to\\nyou; for we came to the fair house of Peleus while beating up recruits\\nthroughout all Achaea, and when we got there we found Menoetius and\\nyourself, and Achilles with you. The old knight Peleus was in the outer\\ncourt, roasting the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to Jove the lord of\\nthunder; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from which he poured\\ndrink-offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice. You two were busy\\ncutting up the heifer, and at that moment we stood at the gates,\\nwhereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led us by the hand into the house,\\nplaced us at table, and set before us such hospitable entertainment as\\nguests expect. When we had satisfied ourselves with meat and drink, I\\nsaid my say and urged both of you to join us. You were ready enough to\\ndo so, and the two old men charged you much and straitly. Old Peleus\\nbade his son Achilles fight ever among the foremost and outvie his\\npeers, while Menoetius the son of Actor spoke thus to you: \\'My son,\\'\\nsaid he, \\'Achilles is of nobler birth than you are, but you are older\\nthan he, though he is far the better man of the two. Counsel him\\nwisely, guide him in the right way, and he will follow you to his own\\nprofit.\\' Thus did your father charge you, but you have forgotten;\\nnevertheless, even now, say all this to Achilles if he will listen to\\nyou. Who knows but with heaven\\'s help you may talk him over, for it is\\ngood to take a friend\\'s advice. If, however, he is fearful about some\\noracle, or if his mother has told him something from Jove, then let him\\nsend you, and let the rest of the Myrmidons follow with you, if\\nperchance you may bring light and saving to the Danaans. And let him\\nsend you into battle clad in his own armour, that the Trojans may\\nmistake you for him and leave off fighting; the sons of the Achaeans\\nmay thus have time to get their breath, for they are hard pressed and\\nthere is little breathing time in battle. You, who are fresh, might\\neasily drive a tired enemy back to his walls and away from the tents\\nand ships.\"\\n\\nWith these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set off running\\nby the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of Aeacus. When he had\\ngot as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was their place of assembly\\nand court of justice, with their altars dedicated to the gods,\\nEurypylus son of Euaemon, met him, wounded in the thigh with an arrow,\\nand limping out of the fight. Sweat rained from his head and shoulders,\\nand black blood welled from his cruel wound, but his mind did not\\nwander. The son of Menoetius when he saw him had compassion upon him\\nand spoke piteously saying, \"O unhappy princes and counsellors of the\\nDanaans, are you then doomed to feed the hounds of Troy with your fat,\\nfar from your friends and your native land? Say, noble Eurypylus, will\\nthe Achaeans be able to hold great Hector in check, or will they fall\\nnow before his spear?\"\\n\\nWounded Eurypylus made answer, \"Noble Patroclus, there is no hope left\\nfor the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All they that\\nwere princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the hands of\\nthe Trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. But save me and take\\nme to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash the black blood\\nfrom off it with warm water, and lay upon it those gracious herbs\\nwhich, so they say, have been shown you by Achilles, who was himself\\nshown them by Chiron, most righteous of all the centaurs. For of the\\nphysicians Podalirius and Machaon, I hear that the one is lying wounded\\nin his tent and is himself in need of healing, while the other is\\nfighting the Trojans upon the plain.\"\\n\\n\"Hero Eurypylus,\" replied the brave son of Menoetius, \"how may these\\nthings be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to noble\\nAchilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even so I\\nwill not be unmindful of your distress.\"\\n\\nWith this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent,\\nand a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground for\\nhim to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharp arrow\\nfrom his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound with warm\\nwater; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his hands, and\\nspread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb which killed all\\npain; so the wound presently dried and the blood left off flowing.',\n",
       " 'Book XVIII\\n\\nTHE FIGHT WITH IRUS--ULYSSES WARNS AMPHINOMUS--PENELOPE GETS PRESENTS\\nFROM THE SUITORS--THE BRAZIERS--ULYSSES REBUKES EURYMACHUS.\\n\\nNow there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all over\\nthe city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton and\\ndrunkard. This man had no strength nor stay in him, but he was a great\\nhulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one his mother gave him,\\nwas Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called him Irus, {148}\\nbecause he used to run errands for any one who would send him. As soon\\nas he came he began to insult Ulysses, and to try and drive him out of\\nhis own house.\\n\\n\"Be off, old man,\" he cried, \"from the doorway, or you shall be dragged\\nout neck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink,\\nand wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so?\\nGet up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come to blows.\"\\n\\nUlysses frowned on him and said, \"My friend, I do you no manner of harm;\\npeople give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is room enough\\nin this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge me things\\nthat are not yours to give. You seem to be just such another tramp as\\nmyself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by and by. Do not,\\nhowever, talk too much about fighting or you will incense me, and old\\nthough I am, I shall cover your mouth and chest with blood. I shall\\nhave more peace tomorrow if I do, for you will not come to the house of\\nUlysses any more.\"\\n\\nIrus was very angry and answered, \"You filthy glutton, you run on\\ntrippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay both hands\\nabout you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar\\'s\\ntusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by and\\nlook on. You will never be able to fight one who is so much younger than\\nyourself.\"\\n\\nThus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front\\nof the doorway, {149} and when Antinous saw what was going on he laughed\\nheartily and said to the others, \"This is the finest sport that you\\never saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this house. The\\nstranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight, let us set them\\non to do so at once.\"\\n\\nThe suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two ragged\\ntramps. \"Listen to me,\" said Antinous, \"there are some goats\\' paunches\\ndown at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set aside\\nfor supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to be the better\\nman shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our table and we\\nwill not allow any other beggar about the house at all.\"\\n\\nThe others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent, said,\\n\"Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold his\\nown against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though\\nI know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear, however\\nthat none of you will give me a foul blow to favour Irus and secure him\\nthe victory.\"\\n\\nThey swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath\\nTelemachus put in a word and said, \"Stranger, if you have a mind to\\nsettle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here. Whoever\\nstrikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host, and the other\\nchiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of understanding, are\\nof the same mind as I am.\"\\n\\nEvery one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,\\nthus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and his\\nmighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even stronger\\nstill. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one would turn\\ntowards his neighbour saying, \"The stranger has brought such a thigh out\\nof his old rags that there will soon be nothing left of Irus.\"\\n\\nIrus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded\\nhim by force, and brought him [into the open part of the court] in such\\na fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded him and\\nsaid, \"You swaggering bully, you ought never to have been born at all if\\nyou are afraid of such an old broken down creature as this tramp is.\\nI say, therefore--and it shall surely be--if he beats you and proves\\nhimself the better man, I shall pack you off on board ship to the\\nmainland and send you to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes\\nnear him. He will cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your entrails\\nfor the dogs to eat.\"\\n\\nThis frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into the middle\\nof the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then Ulysses\\nconsidered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to make an end\\nof him then and there, or whether he should give him a lighter blow that\\nshould only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best to give the\\nlighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to suspect who he was.\\nThen they began to fight, and Irus hit Ulysses on the right shoulder;\\nbut Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the ear that broke in the\\nbones of his skull, and the blood came gushing out of his mouth; he fell\\ngroaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth and kicking on the ground, but\\nthe suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of laughter, as Ulysses\\ncaught hold of him by the foot and dragged him into the outer court as\\nfar as the gate-house. There he propped him up against the wall and put\\nhis staff in his hands. \"Sit here,\" said he, \"and keep the dogs and pigs\\noff; you are a pitiful creature, and if you try to make yourself king of\\nthe beggars any more you shall fare still worse.\"\\n\\nThen he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn over his\\nshoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down upon\\nthe threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing and\\nsaluting him, \"May Jove, and all the other gods,\" said they, \"grant\\nyou whatever you want for having put an end to the importunity of this\\ninsatiable tramp. We will take him over to the mainland presently, to\\nking Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him.\"\\n\\nUlysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat\\'s\\npaunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two loaves\\nout of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he\\ndid so in a golden goblet of wine. \"Good luck to you,\" he said, \"father\\nstranger, you are very badly off at present, but I hope you will have\\nbetter times by and by.\"\\n\\nTo this Ulysses answered, \"Amphinomus, you seem to be a man of good\\nunderstanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you are. I\\nhave heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium, a man\\nboth brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you appear to\\nbe a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take heed to what I am\\nsaying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon\\nearth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and strength, he thinks\\nthat he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even when the blessed gods\\nbring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he needs must, and makes the best\\nof it; for God almighty gives men their daily minds day by day. I know\\nall about it, for I was a rich man once, and did much wrong in the\\nstubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence that my father and my\\nbrothers would support me; therefore let a man fear God in all things\\nalways, and take the good that heaven may see fit to send him without\\nvain glory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors are doing; see how\\nthey are wasting the estate, and doing dishonour to the wife, of one who\\nis certain to return some day, and that, too, not long hence. Nay, he\\nwill be here soon; may heaven send you home quietly first that you may\\nnot meet with him in the day of his coming, for once he is here the\\nsuitors and he will not part bloodlessly.\"\\n\\nWith these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk he put\\nthe gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus, who walked away serious\\nand bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even so he did not\\nescape destruction, for Minerva had doomed him to fall by the hand of\\nTelemachus. So he took his seat again at the place from which he had\\ncome.\\n\\nThen Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the\\nsuitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and win\\nstill further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned a mocking\\nlaugh and said, \"Eurynome, I have changed my mind, and have a fancy to\\nshow myself to the suitors although I detest them. I should like also to\\ngive my son a hint that he had better not have anything more to do with\\nthem. They speak fairly enough but they mean mischief.\"\\n\\n\"My dear child,\" answered Eurynome, \"all that you have said is true,\\ngo and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint your\\nface. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it is not\\nright that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus, whom you\\nalways prayed that you might live to see with a beard, is already grown\\nup.\"\\n\\n\"I know, Eurynome,\" replied Penelope, \"that you mean well, but do not\\ntry and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heaven robbed\\nme of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell\\nAutonoe and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me when I\\nam in the cloister; I am not going among the men alone; it would not be\\nproper for me to do so.\"\\n\\nOn this the old woman {150} went out of the room to bid the maids go to\\ntheir mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another matter,\\nand sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on her couch\\nand her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed grace and\\nbeauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her. She washed\\nher face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears when she goes\\ndancing with the Graces; she made her taller and of a more commanding\\nfigure, while as for her complexion it was whiter than sawn ivory. When\\nMinerva had done all this she went away, whereon the maids came in from\\nthe women\\'s room and woke Penelope with the sound of their talking.\\n\\n\"What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,\" said she, as\\nshe passed her hands over her face, \"in spite of all my misery. I wish\\nDiana would let me die so sweetly now at this very moment, that I\\nmight no longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband, who\\npossessed every kind of good quality and was the most distinguished man\\namong the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nWith these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but\\nattended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she\\nstood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,\\nholding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either\\nside of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and\\nbecame so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might\\nwin her for his own bed fellow.\\n\\n\"Telemachus,\" said she, addressing her son, \"I fear you are no longer so\\ndiscreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were younger you\\nhad a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you are grown up,\\nthough a stranger to look at you would take you for the son of a well to\\ndo father as far as size and good looks go, your conduct is by no means\\nwhat it should be. What is all this disturbance that has been going on,\\nand how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated?\\nWhat would have happened if he had suffered serious injury while a\\nsuppliant in our house? Surely this would have been very discreditable\\nto you.\"\\n\\n\"I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure,\" replied\\nTelemachus, \"I understand all about it and know when things are not\\nas they should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot,\\nhowever, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and then\\nanother of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my mind,\\nand I have no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fight between\\nIrus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it to do,\\nfor the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove, Minerva, and\\nApollo would break the neck of every one of these wooers of yours, some\\ninside the house and some out; and I wish they might all be as limp as\\nIrus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court. See how he nods\\nhis head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing that he cannot\\nstand on his feet nor get back to his home, wherever that may be, for he\\nhas no strength left in him.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, \"Queen\\nPenelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos could\\nsee you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your house\\nby tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole\\nworld both as regards personal beauty and strength of understanding.\"\\n\\nTo this Penelope replied, \"Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my beauty\\nwhether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy and my dear\\nhusband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs, I\\nshould both be more respected and show a better presence to the world.\\nAs it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions which\\nheaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all, and when\\nhe was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand--\\'Wife,\\' he said,\\n\\'we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the Trojans fight\\nwell both with bow and spear. They are excellent also at fighting from\\nchariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight sooner than this. I\\nknow not, therefore, whether heaven will send me back to you, or whether\\nI may not fall over there at Troy. In the meantime do you look after\\nthings here. Take care of my father and mother as at present, and even\\nmore so during my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard,\\nthen marry whom you will, and leave this your present home.\\' This is\\nwhat he said and now it is all coming true. A night will come when I\\nshall have to yield myself to a marriage which I detest, for Jove has\\ntaken from me all hope of happiness. This further grief, moreover, cuts\\nme to the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me after the custom of\\nmy country. When men are courting a woman who they think will be a good\\nwife to them and who is of noble birth, and when they are each trying\\nto win her for himself, they usually bring oxen and sheep to feast the\\nfriends of the lady, and they make her magnificent presents, instead of\\neating up other people\\'s property without paying for it.\"\\n\\nThis was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying\\nto get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair words\\nwhich he knew she did not mean.\\n\\nThen Antinous said, \"Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as many\\npresents as you please from any one who will give them to you; it is not\\nwell to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business nor stir\\nfrom where we are, till you have married the best man among us whoever\\nhe may be.\"\\n\\nThe others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his\\nservant to bring his present. Antinous\\'s man returned with a large and\\nlovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully\\nmade brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus\\nimmediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads that\\ngleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas\\'s two men returned with some\\nearrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened most\\nbeautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a necklace\\nof the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful\\npresent of some kind.\\n\\nThen the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought the\\npresents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and dancing,\\nand stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it grew dark;\\nthey then brought in three braziers {151} to give light, and piled them\\nup with chopped firewood very old and dry, and they lit torches from\\nthem, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then Ulysses said:\\n\\n\"Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the queen\\ninside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick wool.\\nI will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till morning,\\nbut shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal.\"\\n\\nThe maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho began\\nto gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius, but had been\\nbrought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play with, and\\nlooked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all this she\\nshowed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress, and used to\\nmisconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was in love.\\n\\n\"Poor wretch,\" said she, \"are you gone clean out of your mind? Go and\\nsleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering\\nhere. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters--so\\nmany of them too? Has the wine been getting into your head, or do you\\nalways babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you\\nbeat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man than he does not come\\nand cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding out of the\\nhouse.\"\\n\\n\"Vixen,\" replied Ulysses, scowling at her, \"I will go and tell\\nTelemachus what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb\\nfrom limb.\"\\n\\nWith these words he scared the women, and they went off into the body\\nof the house. They trembled all over, for they thought he would do as he\\nsaid. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers, holding up\\ntorches and looking at the people--brooding the while on things that\\nshould surely come to pass.\\n\\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their\\ninsolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against\\nthem; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him,\\nwhich made the others laugh. \"Listen to me,\" said he, \"you suitors of\\nQueen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for\\nnothing that this man has come to the house of Ulysses; I believe the\\nlight has not been coming from the torches, but from his own head--for\\nhis hair is all gone, every bit of it.\"\\n\\nThen turning to Ulysses he said, \"Stranger, will you work as a servant,\\nif I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you build\\na stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year round,\\nand will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not you; for\\nyou have got into bad ways, and do not want to work; you had rather fill\\nyour belly by going round the country begging.\"\\n\\n\"Eurymachus,\" answered Ulysses, \"if you and I were to work one against\\nthe other in early summer when the days are at their longest--give me a\\ngood scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which will last\\nthe longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when the mowing\\ngrass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us each take a\\nyoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and endurance:\\nturn me into a four acre field, and see whether you or I can drive the\\nstraighter furrow. If, again, war were to break out this day, give me\\na shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting well upon my\\ntemples--you would find me foremost in the fray, and would cease your\\ngibes about my belly. You are insolent and cruel, and think yourself\\na great man because you live in a little world, and that a bad one. If\\nUlysses comes to his own again, the doors of his house are wide, but you\\nwill find them narrow when you try to fly through them.\"\\n\\nEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, \"You\\nwretch, I will soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me, and\\nin public too. Has the wine been getting into your head or do you always\\nbabble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you beat the\\ntramp Irus.\" With this he caught hold of a footstool, but Ulysses sought\\nprotection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, for he was afraid.\\nThe stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and knocked him down: the\\nman fell with a cry flat on his back, and his wine-jug fell ringing to\\nthe ground. The suitors in the covered cloister were now in an uproar,\\nand one would turn towards his neighbour, saying, \"I wish the stranger\\nhad gone somewhere else, bad luck to him, for all the trouble he gives\\nus. We cannot permit such disturbance about a beggar; if such ill\\ncounsels are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure at our banquet.\"\\n\\nOn this Telemachus came forward and said, \"Sirs, are you mad? Can you\\nnot carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has\\npossessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you have had\\nyour suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better.\"\\n\\nThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;\\nbut Amphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, \"Do not\\nlet us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer. Neither\\nlet us do violence to the stranger nor to any of Ulysses\\' servants. Let\\nthe cupbearer go round with the drink-offerings, that we may make them\\nand go home to our rest. As for the stranger, let us leave Telemachus to\\ndeal with him, for it is to his house that he has come.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of\\nDulichium, servant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water\\nand handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon they made their\\ndrink-offerings to the blessed gods: Then, when they had made their\\ndrink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded, they took their\\nseveral ways each of them to his own abode.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XX\\n\\n  The gods hold a council and determine to watch the fight, from\\n  the hill Callicolone, and the barrow of Hercules--A fight\\n  between Achilles and AEneas is interrupted by Neptune, who\\n  saves AEneas--Achilles kills many Trojans.\\n\\nTHUS, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son of\\nPeleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over against\\nthem armed upon the rise of the plain.\\n\\nMeanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis gather\\nthe gods in council, whereon she went about and called them to the\\nhouse of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nor a\\nsingle one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of rivers\\nand meadows of green grass. When they reached the house of\\ncloud-compelling Jove, they took their seats in the arcades of polished\\nmarble which Vulcan with his consummate skill had made for father Jove.\\n\\nIn such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove. Neptune\\nalso, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the goddess, and came\\nup out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in the midst of them, he\\nasked what Jove\\'s purpose might be. \"Why,\" said he, \"wielder of the\\nlightning, have you called the gods in council? Are you considering\\nsome matter that concerns the Trojans and Achaeans--for the blaze of\\nbattle is on the point of being kindled between them?\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and wherefore\\nI have called you hither. I take thought for them even in their\\ndestruction. For my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt. Olympus\\nand look on in peace, but do you others go about among Trojans and\\nAchaeans, and help either side as you may be severally disposed. If\\nAchilles fights the Trojans without hindrance they will make no stand\\nagainst him; they have ever trembled at the sight of him, and now that\\nhe is roused to such fury about his comrade, he will override fate\\nitself and storm their city.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took their\\nseveral sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva,\\nearth-encircling Neptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellent in\\nall cunning--all these joined the host that came from the ships; with\\nthem also came Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with his thin\\nlegs plying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined the\\nTrojans, and with him Apollo of locks unshorn, and the archer goddess\\nDiana, Leto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus.\\n\\nSo long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the\\nAchaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fight\\nwas now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him for\\nfear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his armour,\\nand looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympians came to\\ntake their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife, rouser of\\nhosts, and Minerva raised her loud voice, now standing by the deep\\ntrench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with all her might\\nupon the shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed out upon the\\nother side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called on the Trojans\\nat the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and now speeding up\\nthe side of the river Simois till he came to the hill Callicolone.\\n\\nThus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce\\ncontention also among themselves. The sire of gods and men thundered\\nfrom heaven above, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth, and\\nbade the high hills tremble. The spurs and crests of many-fountained\\nIda quaked, as also the city of the Trojans and the ships of the\\nAchaeans. Hades, king of the realms below, was struck with fear; he\\nsprang panic-stricken from his throne and cried aloud in terror lest\\nNeptune, lord of the earthquake, should crack the ground over his head,\\nand lay bare his mouldy mansions to the sight of mortals and\\nimmortals--mansions so ghastly grim that even the gods shudder to think\\nof them. Such was the uproar as the gods came together in battle.\\nApollo with his arrows took his stand to face King Neptune, while\\nMinerva took hers against the god of war; the archer-goddess Diana with\\nher golden arrows, sister of far-darting Apollo, stood to face Juno;\\nMercury the lusty bringer of good luck faced Leto, while the mighty\\neddying river whom men can Scamander, but gods Xanthus, matched himself\\nagainst Vulcan.\\n\\nThe gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the heart of\\nAchilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it was with his\\nblood that he longed above all things else to glut the stubborn lord of\\nbattle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attack the son of Peleus, and\\nput courage into his heart, speaking with the voice of Lycaon son of\\nPriam. In his likeness therefore, he said to Aeneas, \"Aeneas,\\ncounsellor of the Trojans, where are now the brave words with which you\\nvaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes, saying that you would\\nfight Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?\"\\n\\nAnd Aeneas answered, \"Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son of\\nPeleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, it would\\nnot be for the first time. His spear has already put me to flight from\\nIda, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus and Pedasus; Jove\\nindeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to fly, else had I\\nfallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, who went before him to\\nprotect him and urged him to fall upon the Lelegae and Trojans. No man\\nmay fight Achilles, for one of the gods is always with him as his\\nguardian angel, and even were it not so, his weapon flies ever\\nstraight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him who is against him;\\nif heaven would let me fight him on even terms he should not soon\\novercome me, though he boasts that he is made of bronze.\"\\n\\nThen said King Apollo, son to Jove, \"Nay, hero, pray to the ever-living\\ngods, for men say that you were born of Jove\\'s daughter Venus, whereas\\nAchilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus is child to Jove,\\nwhile Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea. Bring,\\ntherefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare you with\\nhis taunts and menaces.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his\\npeople, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremost\\nfighters. Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed\\nJuno, as he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She called the\\ngods about her, and said, \"Look to it, you two, Neptune and Minerva,\\nand consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas\\nclad in full armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turn him back at once,\\nor shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow him with strength so\\nthat his heart fail not, and he may learn that the chiefs of the\\nimmortals are on his side, while the others who have all along been\\ndefending the Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all come down from\\nOlympus and join in the fight, that this day he may take no hurt at the\\nhands of the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whatever fate may have\\nspun out for him when he was begotten and his mother bore him. If\\nAchilles be not thus assured by the voice of a god, he may come to fear\\npresently when one of us meets him in battle, for the gods are terrible\\nif they are seen face to face.\"\\n\\nNeptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, \"Juno, restrain\\nyour fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcing the other gods\\nto fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our own side; let us\\ntake our places on some hill out of the beaten track, and let mortals\\nfight it out among themselves. If Mars or Phoebus Apollo begin\\nfighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannot fight, we too,\\nwill at once raise the cry of battle, and in that case they will soon\\nleave the field and go back vanquished to Olympus among the other gods.\"\\n\\nWith these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high\\nearth-barrow of Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by the\\nTrojans and Pallas Minerva for him to fly to when the sea-monster was\\nchasing him from the shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and those that\\nwere with him took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud of darkness;\\nbut the other gods seated themselves on the brow of Callicolone round\\nyou, O Phoebus, and Mars the waster of cities.\\n\\nThus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side was\\nwilling to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seat on high\\nwas in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain was alive with\\nmen and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. The earth rang\\nagain under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards each other,\\nand two champions, by far the foremost of them all, met between the\\nhosts to fight--to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises, and noble Achilles.\\n\\nAeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet\\ntossing defiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before his\\nbreast, and brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from the\\nother side sprang forth to meet him, like some fierce lion that the\\nwhole country-side has met to hunt and kill--at first he bodes no ill,\\nbut when some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouches\\nopenmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tail from\\nside to side about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springs\\nstraight before him, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slain\\namong the foremost of his foes--even with such fury did Achilles burn\\nto spring upon Aeneas.\\n\\nWhen they were now close up with one another Achilles was first to\\nspeak. \"Aeneas,\" said he, \"why do you stand thus out before the host to\\nfight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the seat of\\nPriam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom over to\\nyou. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his own. Or\\nhave the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness, fair\\nwith orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? This you\\nshall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have you\\nforgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds\\nhelter-skelter down the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to look\\nbehind you; you took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the city, and\\nwith the help of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it and carried its\\nwomen into captivity, though Jove and the other gods rescued you. You\\nthink they will protect you now, but they will not do so; therefore I\\nsay go back into the host, and do not face me, or you will rue it. Even\\na fool may be wise after the event.\"\\n\\nThen Aeneas answered, \"Son of Peleus, think not that your words can\\nscare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can brag and talk\\nunseemly. We know one another\\'s race and parentage as matters of common\\nfame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor I yours. Men say\\nthat you are son to noble Peleus, and that your mother is Thetis,\\nfair-haired daughter of the sea. I have noble Anchises for my father,\\nand Venus for my mother; the parents of one or other of us shall this\\nday mourn a son, for it will be more than silly talk that shall part us\\nwhen the fight is over. Learn, then, my lineage if you will--and it is\\nknown to many.\\n\\n\"In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded Dardania,\\nfor Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men to dwell in, and\\nher people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained Ida. Dardanus\\nhad a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest of all men living; he\\nhad three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and their\\nfoals with them. Boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding, and\\ncovered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly\\nfoals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped over the\\nrich plain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of corn and not\\nbreak them; or again when they would disport themselves on the broad\\nback of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonius\\nbegat Tros, king of the Trojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilus,\\nAssaracus, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the\\ngods carried him off to be Jove\\'s cupbearer, for his beauty\\'s sake,\\nthat he might dwell among the immortals. Ilus begat Laomedon, and\\nLaomedon begat Tithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the\\nstock of Mars. But Assaracus was father to Capys, and Capys to\\nAnchises, who was my father, while Hector is son to Priam.\\n\\n\"Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove gives\\nit or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now let there be\\nno more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were children. We\\ncould fling taunts without end at one another; a hundred-oared galley\\nwould not hold them. The tongue can run all whithers and talk all wise;\\nit can go here and there, and as a man says, so shall he be gainsaid.\\nWhat is the use of our bandying hard like women who when they fall foul\\nof one another go out and wrangle in the streets, one half true and the\\nother lies, as rage inspires them? No words of yours shall turn me now\\nthat I am fain to fight--therefore let us make trial of one another\\nwith our spears.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield of\\nAchilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleus held\\nthe shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid, for he\\ndeemed that Aeneas\\'s spear would go through it quite easily, not\\nreflecting that the god\\'s glorious gifts were little likely to yield\\nbefore the blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas\\'s spear did not\\npierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the\\npoint. It went through two layers, but the god had made the shield in\\nfive, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, and one of gold; it\\nwas in this that the spear was stayed.\\n\\nAchilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas at\\nthe very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelian ash\\nwent clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas was\\nafraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him; the\\nspear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the ground,\\nafter having gone through both circles of the sheltering shield. Aeneas\\nthough he had avoided the spear, stood still, blinded with fear and\\ngrief because the weapon had gone so near him; then Achilles sprang\\nfuriously upon him, with a cry as of death and with his keen blade\\ndrawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that two men, as men\\nnow are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas wielded it quite easily.\\n\\nAeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards him,\\neither on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, and Achilles\\nwould have closed with him and despatched him with his sword, had not\\nNeptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said forthwith\\nto the immortals, \"Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, who will now go\\ndown to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son of Peleus. Fool that\\nhe was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo. Apollo will never save him\\nfrom destruction. Why should this man suffer when he is guiltless, to\\nno purpose, and in another\\'s quarrel? Has he not at all times offered\\nacceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in heaven? Let us then\\nsnatch him from death\\'s jaws, lest the son of Saturn be angry should\\nAchilles slay him. It is fated, moreover, that he should escape, and\\nthat the race of Dardanus, whom Jove loved above all the sons born to\\nhim of mortal women, shall not perish utterly without seed or sign. For\\nnow indeed has Jove hated the blood of Priam, while Aeneas shall reign\\nover the Trojans, he and his children\\'s children that shall be born\\nhereafter.\"\\n\\nThen answered Juno, \"Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, and\\nconsider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer him,\\nbrave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of Peleus. For\\nof a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn full many a time\\nbefore all the immortals, that never would we shield Trojans from\\ndestruction, not even when all Troy is burning in the flames that the\\nAchaeans shall kindle.\"\\n\\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle amid\\nthe clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles and Aeneas\\nwere. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son of\\nPeleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of Aeneas,\\nand laid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas on high from\\noff the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of many a band of\\nwarriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god\\'s hand sped him,\\ntill he came to the very fringe of the battle where the Cauconians were\\narming themselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of the earth, then came\\nnear to him and said, \"Aeneas, what god has egged you on to this folly\\nin fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a mightier man of valour and\\nmore beloved of heaven than you are? Give way before him whensoever you\\nmeet him, lest you go down to the house of Hades even though fate would\\nhave it otherwise. When Achilles is dead you may then fight among the\\nforemost undaunted, for none other of the Achaeans shall slay you.\"\\n\\nThe god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at once\\nremoved the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who opened them\\nwide indeed and said in great anger, \"Alas! what marvel am I now\\nbeholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not him whom I\\nmeant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also must be under\\nheaven\\'s protection, although I had thought his boasting was idle. Let\\nhim go hang; he will be in no mood to fight me further, seeing how\\nnarrowly he has missed being killed. I will now give my orders to the\\nDanaans and attack some other of the Trojans.\"\\n\\nHe sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did so.\\n\"Let not the Trojans,\" he cried, \"keep you at arm\\'s length, Achaeans,\\nbut go for them and fight them man for man. However valiant I may be, I\\ncannot give chase to so many and fight all of them. Even Mars, who is\\nan immortal, or Minerva, would shrink from flinging himself into the\\njaws of such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless, so far as in\\nme lies I will show no slackness of hand or foot nor want of endurance,\\nnot even for a moment; I will utterly break their ranks, and woe to the\\nTrojan who shall venture within reach of my spear.\"\\n\\nThus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans and\\ndeclared that he would fight Achilles. \"Be not afraid, proud Trojans,\"\\nsaid he, \"to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if the\\nbattle were one of words only, but they would be more than a match for\\nme, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deed of Achilles will fall\\nsomewhat short of his word; he will do in part, and the other part he\\nwill clip short. I will go up against him though his hands be as\\nfire--though his hands be fire and his strength iron.\"\\n\\nThus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the Achaeans, and\\nraised the cry of battle as they flung themselves into the midst of\\ntheir ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector and said, \"Hector, on\\nno account must you challenge Achilles to single combat; keep a lookout\\nfor him while you are under cover of the others and away from the thick\\nof the fight, otherwise he will either hit you with a spear or cut you\\ndown at close quarters.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was afraid\\nwhen he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then sprang upon\\nthe Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with a garment.\\nFirst he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of much people whom\\na naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities, in the land of\\nHyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achilles struck him full on\\nthe head as he was coming on towards him, and split it clean in two;\\nwhereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles vaunted over him\\nsaying, \"You be low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; your death is here,\\nbut your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your father\\'s estate\\nlies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters of Hermus.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The\\nchariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him in\\nthe front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, a\\nvaliant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple\\nthrough his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the spear,\\nbut it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain inside was\\nshed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended. Then he\\nstruck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down from his\\nchariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He breathed his last,\\nbellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him to offer\\nhim in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of the\\nearth-shaker is glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying. Achilles\\nthen went in pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his father had\\nalways forbidden to fight because he was the youngest of his sons, the\\none he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in his folly and showing\\noff the fleetness of his feet, was rushing about among front ranks\\nuntil he lost his life, for Achilles struck him in the middle of the\\nback as he was darting past him: he struck him just at the golden\\nfastenings of his belt and where the two pieces of the double\\nbreastplate overlapped. The point of the spear pierced him through and\\ncame out by the navel, whereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a\\ncloud of darkness overshadowed him as he sank holding his entrails in\\nhis hands.\\n\\nWhen Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his hands\\nand sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and he\\ncould not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised his\\nspear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. When Achilles\\nsaw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, \"This is he that has\\nwounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. Not for\\nlong shall we two quail before one another on the highways of war.\"\\n\\nHe looked fiercely on Hector and said, \"Draw near, that you may meet\\nyour doom the sooner.\" Hector feared him not and answered, \"Son of\\nPeleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a\\nchild; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you are\\na mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue lies\\nin the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may not slay you\\nwith my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now.\"\\n\\nHe hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, and\\nthough she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from going\\ntowards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet in\\nfront of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud cry,\\nbent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god can, and\\nhid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards him\\nspear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air. When he\\nrushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god, he shouted\\naloud saying, \"Hound, this time too you have escaped death--but of a\\ntruth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom it seems\\nyou pray before you go into battle, has again saved you; but if I too\\nhave any friend among the gods I will surely make an end of you when I\\ncome across you at some other time. Now, however, I will pursue and\\novertake other Trojans.\"\\n\\nOn this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his neck,\\nand he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and stayed\\nDemouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great stature, by\\nhitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him with his sword\\nand killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus and Dardanus, sons of\\nBias, and threw them from their chariot, the one with a blow from a\\nthrown spear, while the other he cut down in hand-to-hand fight. There\\nwas also Tros the son of Alastor--he came up to Achilles and clasped\\nhis knees in the hope that he would spare him and not kill him but let\\nhim go, because they were both of the same age. Fool, he might have\\nknown that he should not prevail with him, for the man was in no mood\\nfor pity or forbearance but was in grim earnest. Therefore when Tros\\nlaid hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers, Achilles\\ndrove his sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling out, while\\nhis bosom was all covered with the black blood that welled from the\\nwound. Thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless.\\n\\nAchilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with a spear,\\nand the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. He also\\nstruck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which became\\nwarm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes of\\nEcheclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded Deucalion\\nin the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon he\\nwaited Achilles\\' onset with his arm hanging down and death staring him\\nin the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blow from his sword and\\nflung it helmet and all away from him, and the marrow came oozing out\\nof his backbone as he lay. He then went in pursuit of Rhigmus, noble\\nson of Peires, who had come from fertile Thrace, and struck him through\\nthe middle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly, so that he\\nfell headlong from his chariot. He also speared Areithous squire to\\nRhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses in flight, and thrust\\nhim from his chariot, while the horses were struck with panic.\\n\\nAs a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought--and the\\ndense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues of\\nfire in every direction--even so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding\\nhis spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom he\\nwould slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokes\\nbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor--and\\nit is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle--even so\\ndid the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies of the\\nslain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the car were\\nbespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses\\' hoofs, and\\nfrom the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on to win\\nstill further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XXII\\n\\n  The death of Hector.\\n\\nTHUS the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat from\\noff them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the goodly\\nbattlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon their\\nshoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hector stay\\nwhere he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then Phoebus Apollo\\nspoke to the son of Peleus saying, \"Why, son of Peleus, do you, who are\\nbut man, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not yet found out\\nthat it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did not harass the\\nTrojans whom you had routed, and now they are within their walls, while\\nyou have been decoyed hither away from them. Me you cannot kill, for\\ndeath can take no hold upon me.\"\\n\\nAchilles was greatly angered and said, \"You have baulked me,\\nFar-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from the\\nwall, where many another man would have bitten the dust ere he got\\nwithin Ilius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved the\\nTrojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but I\\nwould indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so.\"\\n\\nOn this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the winning\\nhorse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is flying over the\\nplain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of Achilles bear him\\nonwards. King Priam was first to note him as he scoured the plain, all\\nradiant as the star which men call Orion\\'s Hound, and whose beams blaze\\nforth in time of harvest more brilliantly than those of any other that\\nshines by night; brightest of them all though he be, he yet bodes ill\\nfor mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train--even so did\\nAchilles\\' armour gleam on his breast as he sped onwards. Priam raised a\\ncry and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them up and shouted\\nout to his dear son, imploring him to return; but Hector still stayed\\nbefore the gates, for his heart was set upon doing battle with\\nAchilles. The old man reached out his arms towards him and bade him for\\npity\\'s sake come within the walls. \"Hector,\" he cried, \"my son, stay\\nnot to face this man alone and unsupported, or you will meet death at\\nthe hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier than you. Monster\\nthat he is; would indeed that the gods loved him no better than I do,\\nfor so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched on\\nearth, and a load of grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a\\nbrave son has he reft from me, either by killing them or selling them\\naway in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons\\nfrom among the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lycaon and\\nPolydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they be\\nstill alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them with\\ngold and bronze, of which we have store, for the old man Altes endowed\\nhis daughter richly; but if they are already dead and in the house of\\nHades, sorrow will it be to us two who were their parents; albeit the\\ngrief of others will be more short-lived unless you too perish at the\\nhands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the city, to be the\\nguardian of Trojan men and Trojan women, or you will both lose your own\\nlife and afford a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Have pity also\\non your unhappy father while life yet remains to him--on me, whom the\\nson of Saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on the threshold of old\\nage, after I have seen my sons slain and my daughters haled away as\\ncaptives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little children dashed to earth\\namid the rage of battle, and my sons\\' wives dragged away by the cruel\\nhands of the Achaeans; in the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces\\nat my own gates after some one has beaten the life out of my body with\\nsword or spear-hounds that I myself reared and fed at my own table to\\nguard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood and then lie all\\ndistraught at my doors. When a young man falls by the sword in battle,\\nhe may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be\\nseen, all is honourable in death, but when an old man is slain there is\\nnothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile his\\ngrey hair and beard and all that men hide for shame.\"\\n\\nThe old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the heart\\nof Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she bared her\\nbosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. \"Hector,\" she\\ncried, weeping bitterly the while, \"Hector, my son, spurn not this\\nbreast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfort\\nfrom my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wall\\nto protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should the\\nwretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall ever\\nweep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogs\\nwill devour you at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nThus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved not\\nthe heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge Achilles as\\nhe drew nearer towards him. As a serpent in its den upon the mountains,\\nfull fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach of man--he is\\nfilled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes writhing round\\nhis den--even so Hector leaned his shield against a tower that jutted\\nout from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted.\\n\\n\"Alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, \"if I go\\nwithin the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon me,\\nfor it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the city on\\nthat awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would not\\nlisten, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Now that\\nmy folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men and Trojan\\nwomen in the face, lest a worse man should say, \\'Hector has ruined us\\nby his self-confidence.\\' Surely it would be better for me to return\\nafter having fought Achilles and slain him, or to die gloriously here\\nbefore the city. What, again, if I were to lay down my shield and\\nhelmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight up to noble\\nAchilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen, who was the\\nfountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that Alexandrus\\nbrought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let the Achaeans\\ndivide the half of everything that the city contains among themselves?\\nI might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their princes, take a solemn\\noath that they would hide nothing, but would divide into two shares all\\nthat is within the city--but why argue with myself in this way? Were I\\nto go up to him he would show me no kind of mercy; he would kill me\\nthen and there as easily as though I were a woman, when I had off my\\narmour. There is no parleying with him from some rock or oak tree as\\nyoung men and maidens prattle with one another. Better fight him at\\nonce, and learn to which of us Jove will vouchsafe victory.\"\\n\\nThus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it were\\nMars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder he\\nbrandished his terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamed\\naround him like flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fell\\nupon Hector as he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he was\\nbut fled in dismay from before the gates, while Achilles darted after\\nhim at his utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds,\\nswoops down upon some cowering dove--the dove flies before him but the\\nfalcon with a shrill scream follows close after, resolved to have\\nher--even so did Achilles make straight for Hector with all his might,\\nwhile Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take\\nhim.\\n\\nOn they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the wall,\\npast the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild fig-tree,\\ntill they came to two fair springs which feed the river Scamander. One\\nof these two springs is warm, and steam rises from it as smoke from a\\nburning fire, but the other even in summer is as cold as hail or snow,\\nor the ice that forms on water. Here, hard by the springs, are the\\ngoodly washing-troughs of stone, where in the time of peace before the\\ncoming of the Achaeans the wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used\\nto wash their clothes. Past these did they fly, the one in front and\\nthe other giving chase behind him: good was the man that fled, but\\nbetter far was he that followed after, and swiftly indeed did they run,\\nfor the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice or bullock\\'s hide, as it\\nmight be for a common foot-race, but they ran for the life of Hector.\\nAs horses in a chariot race speed round the turning-posts when they are\\nrunning for some great prize--a tripod or woman--at the games in honour\\nof some dead hero, so did these two run full speed three times round\\nthe city of Priam. All the gods watched them, and the sire of gods and\\nmen was the first to speak.\\n\\n\"Alas,\" said he, \"my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being pursued\\nround the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for Hector, who has\\nburned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honour, one while on the\\ncrests of many-valleyed Ida, and again on the citadel of Troy; and now\\nI see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him round the city of Priam.\\nWhat say you? Consider among yourselves and decide whether we shall now\\nsave him or let him fall, valiant though he be, before Achilles, son of\\nPeleus.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud and\\nstorm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doom has long\\nbeen decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we others\\nshall not be of a mind with you.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not speak\\nin full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do without let or\\nhindrance as you are minded.\"\\n\\nThus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she darted\\nfrom the topmost summits of Olympus.\\n\\nAchilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing a fawn\\nwhich he has started from its covert on the mountains, and hunts\\nthrough glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by crouching\\nunder cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her up\\nuntil he gets her--even so there was no escape for Hector from the\\nfleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian\\ngates and under the walls, that his people might help him by showering\\ndown weapons from above, Achilles would gain on him and head him back\\ntowards the plain, keeping himself always on the city side. As a man in\\na dream who fails to lay hands upon another whom he is pursuing--the\\none cannot escape nor the other overtake--even so neither could\\nAchilles come up with Hector, nor Hector break away from Achilles;\\nnevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not the time come\\nwhen Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved his\\nrunning, was now no longer to stay by him. Achilles made signs to the\\nAchaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to aim a dart\\nat Hector, lest another might win the glory of having hit him and he\\nmight himself come in second. Then, at last, as they were nearing the\\nfountains for the fourth time, the father of all balanced his golden\\nscales and placed a doom in each of them, one for Achilles and the\\nother for Hector. As he held the scales by the middle, the doom of\\nHector fell down deep into the house of Hades--and then Phoebus Apollo\\nleft him. Thereon Minerva went close up to the son of Peleus and said,\\n\"Noble Achilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to\\nthe ships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his\\nlust of battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling before his\\nfather, aegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer. Stay here\\nand take breath, while I go up to him and persuade him to make a stand\\nand fight you.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still,\\nleaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left him and\\nwent after Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. She came\\nclose up to him and said, \"Dear brother, I see you are hard pressed by\\nAchilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city of Priam, let\\nus await his onset and stand on our defence.\"\\n\\nAnd Hector answered, \"Deiphobus, you have always been dearest to me of\\nall my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforth I shall\\nrate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured outside the\\nwall for my sake when all the others remain inside.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Dear brother, my father and mother went down on\\ntheir knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain inside,\\nso great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an agony of\\ngrief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a stand and\\nfight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve, that we may\\nlearn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off our spoils to the\\nships, or whether he shall fall before you.\"\\n\\nThus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two were now\\nclose to one another great Hector was first to speak. \"I will no longer\\nfly you, son of Peleus,\" said he, \"as I have been doing hitherto. Three\\ntimes have I fled round the mighty city of Priam, without daring to\\nwithstand you, but now, let me either slay or be slain, for I am in the\\nmind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to one another by our\\ngods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardians of all covenants; let\\nit be agreed between us that if Jove vouchsafes me the longer stay and\\nI take your life, I am not to treat your dead body in any unseemly\\nfashion, but when I have stripped you of your armour, I am to give up\\nyour body to the Achaeans. And do you likewise.\"\\n\\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Fool, prate not to me about\\ncovenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves and\\nlambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out all\\nthrough. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and me,\\nnor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall fall\\nand glut grim Mars with his life\\'s blood. Put forth all your strength;\\nyou have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldier and man of\\nwar. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva will forthwith\\nvanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full for the grief\\nyou have caused me on account of my comrades whom you have killed in\\nbattle.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it coming and\\navoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew over his\\nhead and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it up and\\ngave it back to Achilles without Hector\\'s seeing her; Hector thereon\\nsaid to the son of Peleus, \"You have missed your aim, Achilles, peer of\\nthe gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you the hour of my doom,\\nthough you made sure that he had done so. You were a false-tongued liar\\nwhen you deemed that I should forget my valour and quail before you.\\nYou shall not drive your spear into the back of a runaway--drive it,\\nshould heaven so grant you power, drive it into me as I make straight\\ntowards you; and now for your own part avoid my spear if you can--would\\nthat you might receive the whole of it into your body; if you were once\\ndead the Trojans would find the war an easier matter, for it is you who\\nhave harmed them most.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true for he\\nhit the middle of Achilles\\' shield, but the spear rebounded from it,\\nand did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw that the weapon had\\nsped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had no\\nsecond spear. With a loud cry he called Deiphobus and asked him for\\none, but there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to himself,\\n\"Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. I deemed that the\\nhero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within the wall, and Minerva\\nhas inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and\\nthere is no way out of it--for so Jove and his son Apollo the\\nfar-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready\\nto protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die\\ningloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great\\nthing that shall be told among men hereafter.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong by his\\nside, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles like a\\nsoaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb or\\ntimid hare--even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon\\nAchilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrous\\nshield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with four\\nlayers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. The thick tresses of gold\\nwith which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as the\\nevening star that shines brighter than all others through the stillness\\nof night, even such was the gleam of the spear which Achilles poised in\\nhis right hand, fraught with the death of noble Hector. He eyed his\\nfair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound it, but all\\nwas protected by the goodly armour of which Hector had spoiled\\nPatroclus after he had slain him, save only the throat where the\\ncollar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders, and this is a most\\ndeadly place: here then did Achilles strike him as he was coming on\\ntowards him, and the point of his spear went right through the fleshy\\npart of the neck, but it did not sever his windpipe so that he could\\nstill speak. Hector fell headlong, and Achilles vaunted over him\\nsaying, \"Hector, you deemed that you should come off scatheless when\\nyou were spoiling Patroclus, and recked not of myself who was not with\\nhim. Fool that you were: for I, his comrade, mightier far than he, was\\nstill left behind him at the ships, and now I have laid you low. The\\nAchaeans shall give him all due funeral rites, while dogs and vultures\\nshall work their will upon yourself.\"\\n\\nThen Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, \"I pray you by your\\nlife and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me at the\\nships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and bronze\\nwhich my father and mother will offer you, and send my body home, that\\nthe Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when I am dead.\"\\n\\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Dog, talk not to me neither of\\nknees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able to cut\\nyour flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill you have done me, as\\nI am that nothing shall save you from the dogs--it shall not be, though\\nthey bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me on the\\nspot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son of Dardanus\\nshould bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so your mother shall\\nnever lay you out and make lament over the son she bore, but dogs and\\nvultures shall eat you utterly up.\"\\n\\nHector with his dying breath then said, \"I know you what you are, and\\nwas sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard as iron;\\nlook to it that I bring not heaven\\'s anger upon you on the day when\\nParis and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you at the\\nScaean gates.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon his\\nsoul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamenting its\\nsad fate that it should enjoy youth and strength no longer. But\\nAchilles said, speaking to the dead body, \"Die; for my part I will\\naccept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send it.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one side;\\nthen he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector\\'s shoulders while\\nthe other Achaeans came running up to view his wondrous strength and\\nbeauty; and no one came near him without giving him a fresh wound. Then\\nwould one turn to his neighbour and say, \"It is easier to handle Hector\\nnow than when he was flinging fire on to our ships\"--and as he spoke he\\nwould thrust his spear into him anew.\\n\\nWhen Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood among\\nthe Argives and said, \"My friends, princes and counsellors of the\\nArgives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, who\\nhas done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether we\\nshould not attack the city in force, and discover in what mind the\\nTrojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will desert their\\ncity now that Hector has fallen, or will still hold out even though he\\nis no longer living. But why argue with myself in this way, while\\nPatroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, and unmourned--he whom\\nI can never forget so long as I am alive and my strength fails not?\\nThough men forget their dead when once they are within the house of\\nHades, yet not even there will I forget the comrade whom I have lost.\\nNow, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise the song of victory and go\\nback to the ships taking this man along with us; for we have achieved a\\nmighty triumph and have slain noble Hector to whom the Trojans prayed\\nthroughout their city as though he were a god.\"\\n\\nOn this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced the\\nsinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passed\\nthongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the body\\nfast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground. Then when\\nhe had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself mounted, he\\nlashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth. The dust rose\\nfrom Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew all\\nabroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on earth, for Jove had\\nnow delivered him into the hands of his foes to do him outrage in his\\nown land.\\n\\nThus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His mother\\ntore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as she\\nlooked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and throughout the\\ncity the people fell to weeping and wailing. It was as though the whole\\nof frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire. Hardly could the people\\nhold Priam back in his hot haste to rush without the gates of the city.\\nHe grovelled in the mire and besought them, calling each one of them by\\nhis name. \"Let be, my friends,\" he cried, \"and for all your sorrow,\\nsuffer me to go single-handed to the ships of the Achaeans. Let me\\nbeseech this cruel and terrible man, if maybe he will respect the\\nfeeling of his fellow-men, and have compassion on my old age. His own\\nfather is even such another as myself--Peleus, who bred him and reared\\nhim to be the bane of us Trojans, and of myself more than of all\\nothers. Many a son of mine has he slain in the flower of his youth, and\\nyet, grieve for these as I may, I do so for one--Hector--more than for\\nthem all, and the bitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to the\\nhouse of Hades. Would that he had died in my arms, for so both his\\nill-starred mother who bore him, and myself, should have had the\\ncomfort of weeping and mourning over him.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city\\njoined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among the\\nTrojans. \"Alas, my son,\" she cried, \"what have I left to live for now\\nthat you are no more? Night and day did I glory in you throughout the\\ncity, for you were a tower of strength to all in Troy, and both men and\\nwomen alike hailed you as a god. So long as you lived you were their\\npride, but now death and destruction have fallen upon you.\"\\n\\nHector\\'s wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to tell her\\nthat her husband had remained without the gates. She was at her loom in\\nan inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web, and\\nembroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set a large\\ntripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hector when he\\ncame out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now beyond the\\nreach of baths, and that Minerva had laid him low by the hands of\\nAchilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, and trembled in\\nevery limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again she spoke to her\\nwaiting-women. \"Two of you,\" she said, \"come with me that I may learn\\nwhat it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my husband\\'s\\nhonoured mother; my own heart beats as though it would come into my\\nmouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great misfortune for\\nPriam\\'s children must be at hand. May I never live to hear it, but I\\ngreatly fear that Achilles has cut off the retreat of brave Hector and\\nhas chased him on to the plain where he was singlehanded; I fear he may\\nhave put an end to the reckless daring which possessed my husband, who\\nwould never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far in\\nfront, foremost of them all in valour.\"\\n\\nHer heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like a\\nmaniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached the\\nbattlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon the\\nwall, and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city--the horses\\ndragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the ships of\\nthe Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness of night\\nand she fell fainting backwards. She tore the attiring from her head\\nand flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaited band, and\\nthe veil which golden Venus had given her on the day when Hector took\\nher with him from the house of Eetion, after having given countless\\ngifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband\\'s sisters and the wives of\\nhis brothers crowded round her and supported her, for she was fain to\\ndie in her distraction; when she again presently breathed and came to\\nherself, she sobbed and made lament among the Trojans saying, \"Woe is\\nme, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common lot we were born, you\\nat Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes under the wooded\\nmountain of Placus in the house of Eetion who brought me up when I was\\na child--ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter--would that he had\\nnever begotten me. You are now going into the house of Hades under the\\nsecret places of the earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your\\nhouse. The child, of whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet\\na mere infant. Now that you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for\\nhim nor he for you. Even though he escape the horrors of this woeful\\nwar with the Achaeans, yet shall his life henceforth be one of labour\\nand sorrow, for others will seize his lands. The day that robs a child\\nof his parents severs him from his own kind; his head is bowed, his\\ncheeks are wet with tears, and he will go about destitute among the\\nfriends of his father, plucking one by the cloak and another by the\\nshirt. Some one or other of these may so far pity him as to hold the\\ncup for a moment towards him and let him moisten his lips, but he must\\nnot drink enough to wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose parents\\nare alive will drive him from the table with blows and angry words.\\n\\'Out with you,\\' he will say, \\'you have no father here,\\' and the child\\nwill go crying back to his widowed mother--he, Astyanax, who erewhile\\nwould sit upon his father\\'s knees, and have none but the daintiest and\\nchoicest morsels set before him. When he had played till he was tired\\nand went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, on\\na soft couch, knowing neither want nor care, whereas now that he has\\nlost his father his lot will be full of hardship--he, whom the Trojans\\nname Astyanax, because you, O Hector, were the only defence of their\\ngates and battlements. The wriggling writhing worms will now eat you at\\nthe ships, far from your parents, when the dogs have glutted themselves\\nupon you. You will lie naked, although in your house you have fine and\\ngoodly raiment made by hands of women. This will I now burn; it is of\\nno use to you, for you can never again wear it, and thus you will have\\nrespect shown you by the Trojans both men and women.\"\\n\\nIn such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women joined in\\nher lament.',\n",
       " 'BOOK X\\n\\n  Ulysses and Diomed go out as spies, and meet Dolon, who gives\\n  them information: they then kill him, and profiting by what\\n  he had told them, kill Rhesus king of the Thracians and take\\n  his horses.\\n\\nNOW the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole night\\nthrough, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that he could get\\nno rest. As when fair Juno\\'s lord flashes his lightning in token of\\ngreat rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground, or\\nagain as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry war, even so\\ndid Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled within\\nhim. When he looked upon the plain of Troy he marvelled at the many\\nwatchfires burning in front of Ilius, and at the sound of pipes and\\nflutes and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned towards the\\nships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hair by handfuls before\\nJove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness of his soul.\\nIn the end he deemed it best to go at once to Nestor son of Neleus, and\\nsee if between them they could find any way of the Achaeans from\\ndestruction. He therefore rose, put on his shirt, bound his sandals\\nabout his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawny lion over his\\nshoulders--a skin that reached his feet--and took his spear in his hand.\\n\\nNeither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argives\\nwho for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight the\\nTrojans. He covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther,\\nput a casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawny\\nhand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most\\npowerful of the Achaeans, and was honoured by the people as though he\\nwere a god. He found him by the stern of his ship already putting his\\ngoodly array about his shoulders, and right glad was he that his\\nbrother had come.\\n\\nMenelaus spoke first. \"Why,\" said he, \"my dear brother, are you thus\\narming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit the\\nTrojans? I greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and spy\\nupon the enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed of great\\ndaring.\"\\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Menelaus, we both of us need shrewd\\ncounsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed his\\nmind, and inclines towards Hector\\'s sacrifices rather than ours. I\\nnever saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in one\\nday as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans--and\\nthat too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god nor\\ngoddess. The Argives will rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore, with\\nall speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus.\\nMeanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him rise and go about among the\\ncompanies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; they will\\nlisten to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, and Meriones\\nbrother in arms to Idomeneus, are captains over them. It was to them\\nmore particularly that we gave this charge.\"\\n\\nMenelaus replied, \"How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with them\\nand wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have given\\nyour orders?\" \"Wait,\" answered King Agamemnon, \"for there are so many\\npaths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call every man on\\nyour way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage and by his\\nfather\\'s name, give each all titular observance, and stand not too much\\nupon your own dignity; we must take our full share of toil, for at our\\nbirth Jove laid this heavy burden upon us.\"\\n\\nWith these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went on to\\nNestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his tent hard\\nby his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him--his shield, his two\\nspears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdle with\\nwhich the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his people into\\nbattle--for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his elbow and\\nlooked up at Agamemnon. \"Who is it,\" said he, \"that goes thus about the\\nhost and the ships alone and in the dead of night, when men are\\nsleeping? Are you looking for one of your mules or for some comrade? Do\\nnot stand there and say nothing, but speak. What is your business?\"\\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\\nname, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove has laid labour\\nand sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and my limbs carry me.\\nI am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my eyelids, but my heart\\nis big with war and with the jeopardy of the Achaeans. I am in great\\nfear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and without sure counsel; my heart\\nbeats as though it would leap out of my body, and my limbs fail me. If\\nthen you can do anything--for you too cannot sleep--let us go the round\\nof the watch, and see whether they are drowsy with toil and sleeping to\\nthe neglect of their duty. The enemy is encamped hard and we know not\\nbut he may attack us by night.\"\\n\\nNestor replied, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, Jove\\nwill not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he will; he will have\\ntroubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger. I will go\\nwith you, and we will rouse others, either the son of Tydeus, or\\nUlysses, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Some one had\\nalso better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for their ships are\\nnot near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot however refrain from\\nblaming Menelaus, much as I love him and respect him--and I will say so\\nplainly, even at the risk of offending you--for sleeping and leaving\\nall this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going about imploring aid\\nfrom all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are in extreme danger.\"\\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly, for\\nhe is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself--not indeed from\\nsloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects me\\nto take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before I was,\\nand came to me of his own accord. I have already sent him to call the\\nvery men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We shall find\\nthem with the watch outside the gates, for it was there I said that we\\nwould meet them.\"\\n\\n\"In that case,\" answered Nestor, \"the Argives will not blame him nor\\ndisobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives them\\ninstructions.\"\\n\\nWith this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his comely\\nfeet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large, and of\\na rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and\\nwended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. First he called\\nloudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for he was soon\\nroused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside his tent and\\nsaid, \"Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along the line of\\nthe ships in the stillness of the night? What is it that you find so\\nurgent?\" And Nestor knight of Gerene answered, \"Ulysses, noble son of\\nLaertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great straits. Come\\nwith me and let us wake some other, who may advise well with us whether\\nwe shall fight or fly.\"\\n\\nOn this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about his\\nshoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed son of\\nTydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with his\\ncomrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as for\\ntheir spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts that were\\ndriven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afar like the\\nlightning of father Jove. The hero was sleeping upon the skin of an ox,\\nwith a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor went up to him and\\nstirred him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding him and urging him\\nto bestir himself. \"Wake up,\" he exclaimed, \"son of Tydeus. How can you\\nsleep on in this way? Can you not see that the Trojans are encamped on\\nthe brow of the plain hard by our ships, with but a little space\\nbetween us and them?\"\\n\\nOn these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, \"Old man, your\\nheart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. Are there\\nno younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the\\nprinces? There is no tiring you.\"\\n\\nAnd Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, \"My son, all that you have\\nsaid is true. I have good sons, and also much people who might call the\\nchieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and death\\nare balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Go then, for you are\\nyounger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax and the fleet son of\\nPhyleus.\"\\n\\nDiomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders--a skin\\nthat reached his feet--and grasped his spear. When he had roused the\\nheroes, he brought them back with him; they then went the round of\\nthose who were on guard, and found the captains not sleeping at their\\nposts but wakeful and sitting with their arms about them. As sheep dogs\\nthat watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear a wild beast\\ncoming through the mountain forest towards them--forthwith there is a\\nhue and cry of dogs and men, and slumber is broken--even so was sleep\\nchased from the eyes of the Achaeans as they kept the watches of the\\nwicked night, for they turned constantly towards the plain whenever\\nthey heard any stir among the Trojans. The old man was glad and bade\\nthem be of good cheer. \"Watch on, my children,\" said he, \"and let not\\nsleep get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph over us.\"\\n\\nWith this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of the\\nAchaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the brave son\\nof Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they were beyond\\nthe trench that was dug round the wall they held their meeting on the\\nopen ground where there was a space clear of corpses, for it was here\\nthat when night fell Hector had turned back from his onslaught on the\\nArgives. They sat down, therefore, and held debate with one another.\\n\\nNestor spoke first. \"My friends,\" said he, \"is there any man bold\\nenough to venture among the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or\\nbring us news of what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here\\nby the ships away from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted\\nthe Achaeans, they will retire within their walls. If he could learn\\nall this and come back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven in\\nthe mouths of all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs\\nfrom all our ships would each of them give him a black ewe with her\\nlamb--which is a present of surpassing value--and he would be asked as\\na guest to all feasts and clan-gatherings.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke saying,\\n\"Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans over against us,\\nbut if another will go with me I shall do so in greater confidence and\\ncomfort. When two men are together, one of them may see some\\nopportunity which the other has not caught sight of; if a man is alone\\nhe is less full of resource, and his wit is weaker.\"\\n\\nOn this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes, servants of\\nMars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so did Menelaus\\nson of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the host of the Trojans,\\nfor he was ever full of daring, and thereon Agamemnon king of men spoke\\nthus: \"Diomed,\" said he, \"son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, choose\\nyour comrade for yourself--take the best man of those that have\\noffered, for many would now go with you. Do not through delicacy reject\\nthe better man, and take the worst out of respect for his lineage,\\nbecause he is of more royal blood.\"\\n\\nHe said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, \"If you\\nbid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I fail to\\nthink of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to face all\\nkinds of danger--and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he were to go\\nwith me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is quick to\\nsee and understand.\"\\n\\n\"Son of Tydeus,\" replied Ulysses, \"say neither good nor ill about me,\\nfor you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going, for the\\nnight wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward,\\ntwo-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone left\\nus.\"\\n\\nThey then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son of\\nTydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his ship)\\nand on his head he set a helmet of bull\\'s hide without either peak or\\ncrest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear. Meriones\\nfound a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he set a leathern\\nhelmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathern thongs, while\\non the outside it was thickly studded with boar\\'s teeth, well and\\nskilfully set into it; next the head there was an inner lining of felt.\\nThis helmet had been stolen by Autolycus out of Eleon when he broke\\ninto the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus. He gave it to Amphidamas of\\nCythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift to\\nMolus, who gave it to his son Meriones; and now it was set upon the\\nhead of Ulysses.\\n\\nWhen the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftains\\nbehind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upon their\\nright hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but they heard its\\ncry. Ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed to Minerva: \"Hear\\nme,\" he cried, \"daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you who spy out all my\\nways and who are with me in all my hardships; befriend me in this mine\\nhour, and grant that we may return to the ships covered with glory\\nafter having achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring sorrow to\\nthe Trojans.\"\\n\\nThen Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: \"Hear me too,\" said he,\\n\"daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with my\\nnoble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by the\\nAchaeans. He left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus, and\\nwent to the city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians; on his\\nreturn thence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds of daring,\\nfor you were his ready helper. Even so guide me and guard me now, and\\nin return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year\\nold, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild\\nher horns and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.\"\\n\\nThus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When they had\\ndone praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went their way like\\ntwo lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stained bodies of\\nthem that had fallen.\\n\\nNeither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called the\\nprinces and councillors of the Trojans that he might set his counsel\\nbefore them. \"Is there one,\" said he, \"who for a great reward will do\\nme the service of which I will tell you? He shall be well paid if he\\nwill. I will give him a chariot and a couple of horses, the fleetest\\nthat can be found at the ships of the Achaeans, if he will dare this\\nthing; and he will win infinite honour to boot; he must go to the ships\\nand find out whether they are still guarded as heretofore, or whether\\nnow that we have beaten them the Achaeans design to fly, and through\\nsheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their watches.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certain\\nman named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald--a man rich in gold\\nand bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an only son\\namong five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans. \"I,\\nHector,\" said he, \"Will to the ships and will exploit them. But first\\nhold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me the chariot,\\nbedight with bronze, and the horses that now carry the noble son of\\nPeleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not fail you. I will go\\nthrough the host from one end to the other till I come to the ship of\\nAgamemnon, where I take it the princes of the Achaeans are now\\nconsulting whether they shall fight or fly.\"\\n\\nWhen he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore him his\\noath saying, \"May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bear witness that\\nno other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds, and that you\\nshall have your will with them for ever.\"\\n\\nThe oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on going.\\nHe hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he wore the skin\\nof a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferret skin. Then he\\ntook a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships, but he was not\\nto return with any news for Hector. When he had left the horses and the\\ntroops behind him, he made all speed on his way, but Ulysses perceived\\nhis coming and said to Diomed, \"Diomed, here is some one from the camp;\\nI am not sure whether he is a spy, or whether it is some thief who\\nwould plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a little past us, we\\ncan then spring upon him and take him. If, however, he is too quick for\\nus, go after him with your spear and hem him in towards the ships away\\nfrom the Trojan camp, to prevent his getting back to the town.\"\\n\\nWith this they turned out of their way and lay down among the corpses.\\nDolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he had got about\\nas far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds one that\\nhas been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land quicker than\\noxen) they ran after him, and when he heard their footsteps he stood\\nstill, for he made sure they were friends from the Trojan camp come by\\nHector\\'s orders to bid him return; when, however, they were only a\\nspear\\'s cast, or less, away from him, he saw that they were enemies and ran\\nas fast as his legs could take him. The others gave chase at once, and as\\na couple of well-trained hounds press forward after a doe or hare that\\nruns screaming in front of them, even so did the son of Tydeus and\\nUlysses pursue Dolon and cut him off from his own people. But when he\\nhad fled so far towards the ships that he would soon have fallen in\\nwith the outposts, Minerva infused fresh strength into the son of\\nTydeus for fear some other of the Achaeans might have the glory of\\nbeing first to hit him, and he might himself be only second; he\\ntherefore sprang forward with his spear and said, \"Stand, or I shall\\nthrow my spear, and in that case I shall soon make an end of you.\"\\n\\nHe threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flew over\\nthe man\\'s right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. He stood stock\\nstill, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered, and he turned\\npale with fear. The two came breathless up to him and seized his hands,\\nwhereon he began to weep and said, \"Take me alive; I will ransom\\nmyself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from\\nthis my father will satisfy you with a very large ransom, should he\\nhear of my being alive at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\n\"Fear not,\" replied Ulysses, \"let no thought of death be in your mind;\\nbut tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about alone in\\nthe dead of night away from your camp and towards the ships, while\\nother men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies of the slain, or\\ndid Hector send you to spy out what was going on at the ships? Or did\\nyou come here of your own mere notion?\"\\n\\nDolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: \"Hector, with his vain\\nflattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. He said he\\nwould give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and his\\nbronze-bedizened chariot; he bade me go through the darkness of the\\nflying night, get close to the enemy, and find out whether the ships\\nare still guarded as heretofore, or whether, now that we have beaten\\nthem, the Achaeans design to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are\\nneglecting to keep their watches.\"\\n\\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, \"You had indeed set your heart upon\\na great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus are hardly\\nto be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than Achilles\\nhimself, whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, and tell me true,\\nwhere did you leave Hector when you started? Where lies his armour and\\nhis horses? How, too, are the watches and sleeping-ground of the\\nTrojans ordered? What are their plans? Will they stay here by the ships\\nand away from the city, or now that they have worsted the Achaeans,\\nwill they retire within their walls?\"\\n\\nAnd Dolon answered, \"I will tell you truly all. Hector and the other\\ncouncillors are now holding conference by the monument of great Ilus,\\naway from the general tumult; as for the guards about which you ask me,\\nthere is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host. The Trojans have\\ntheir watchfires, for they are bound to have them; they, therefore, are\\nawake and keep each other to their duty as sentinels; but the allies\\nwho have come from other places are asleep and leave it to the Trojans\\nto keep guard, for their wives and children are not here.\"\\n\\nUlysses then said, \"Now tell me; are they sleeping among the Trojan\\ntroops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may understand it.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you truly all,\" replied Dolon. \"To the seaward lie the\\nCarians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians, and the\\nnoble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians and\\nMeonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask\\nabout all this? If you want to find your way into the host of the\\nTrojans, there are the Thracians, who have lately come here and lie\\napart from the others at the far end of the camp; and they have Rhesus\\nson of Eioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and strongest\\nthat I have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than any\\nwind that blows. His chariot is bedight with silver and gold, and he\\nhas brought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarest\\nworkmanship--too splendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet only\\nfor the gods. Now, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securely\\nhere, until you come back and have proved my words whether they be\\nfalse or true.\"\\n\\nDiomed looked sternly at him and answered, \"Think not, Dolon, for all\\nthe good information you have given us, that you shall escape now you\\nare in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you will come\\nsome second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spy or as an\\nopen enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you will give no more\\ntrouble.\"\\n\\nOn this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him\\nfurther, but Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his sword\\nand cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the dust\\nwhile he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his head,\\nand also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysses hung them\\nup aloft in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, and prayed\\nsaying, \"Accept these, goddess, for we give them to you in preference\\nto all the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us still further towards\\nthe horses and sleeping-ground of the Thracians.\"\\n\\nWith these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk tree,\\nand they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering boughs of\\ntamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through the\\nflying hours of darkness. The two then went onwards amid the fallen\\narmour and the blood, and came presently to the company of Thracian\\nsoldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with their day\\'s toil; their\\ngoodly armour was lying on the ground beside them all orderly in three\\nrows, and each man had his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus was\\nsleeping in the middle, and hard by him his horses were made fast to\\nthe topmost rim of his chariot. Ulysses from some way off saw him and\\nsaid, \"This, Diomed, is the man, and these are the horses about which\\nDolon whom we killed told us. Do your very utmost; dally not about your\\narmour, but loose the horses at once--or else kill the men yourself,\\nwhile I see to the horses.\"\\n\\nThereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smote them\\nright and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were being hacked\\nabout, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion springs\\nfuriously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds them without\\ntheir shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thracian soldiers\\ntill he had killed twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came and drew them\\naside by their feet one by one, that the horses might go forward freely\\nwithout being frightened as they passed over the dead bodies, for they\\nwere not yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus came to the king, he\\nkilled him too (which made thirteen), as he was breathing hard, for by\\nthe counsel of Minerva an evil dream, the seed of Oeneus, hovered that\\nnight over his head. Meanwhile Ulysses untied the horses, made them\\nfast one to another and drove them off, striking them with his bow, for\\nhe had forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. Then he whistled as\\na sign to Diomed.\\n\\nBut Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed he\\nmight accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in which\\nthe king\\'s armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to lift\\nthe armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not kill\\nsome more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came up to\\nhim and said, \"Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may be driven\\nthither, should some other god rouse the Trojans.\"\\n\\nDiomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the\\nhorses. Ulysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to the\\nships of the Achaeans.\\n\\nBut Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the son of\\nTydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of the Trojans he\\nroused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noble kinsman of\\nRhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that the horses were no\\nlonger in their place, and that the men were gasping in their\\ndeath-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend by\\nname. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as the people kept\\nhurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds of the heroes who\\nhad now got away towards the ships.\\n\\nWhen they reached the place where they had killed Hector\\'s scout,\\nUlysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the\\nground, placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses and\\nremounted: then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forward\\nnothing loth towards the ships as though of their own free will. Nestor\\nwas first to hear the tramp of their feet. \"My friends,\" said he,\\n\"princes and counsellors of the Argives, shall I guess right or\\nwrong?--but I must say what I think: there is a sound in my ears as of\\nthe tramp of horses. I hope it may be Diomed and Ulysses driving in\\nhorses from the Trojans, but I much fear that the bravest of the\\nArgives may have come to some harm at their hands.\"\\n\\nHe had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted,\\nwhereon the others shook hands right gladly with them and congratulated\\nthem. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to question them. \"Tell me,\"\\nsaid he, \"renowned Ulysses, how did you two come by these horses? Did\\nyou steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some god meet you and give\\nthem to you? They are like sunbeams. I am well conversant with the\\nTrojans, for old warrior though I am I never hold back by the ships,\\nbut I never yet saw or heard of such horses as these are. Surely some\\ngod must have met you and given them to you, for you are both of you\\ndear to Jove, and to Jove\\'s daughter Minerva.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\\nname, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses than these,\\nfor the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses, however, about\\nwhich you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace. Diomed killed their\\nking with the twelve bravest of his companions. Hard by the ships we\\ntook a thirteenth man--a scout whom Hector and the other Trojans had\\nsent as a spy upon our ships.\"\\n\\nHe laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while the\\nother Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the strongly\\nbuilt quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with thongs\\nof leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stood eating their\\nsweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils of Dolon at the\\nstern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering to\\nMinerva. As for themselves, they went into the sea and washed the sweat\\nfrom their bodies, and from their necks and thighs. When the sea-water\\nhad taken all the sweat from off them, and had refreshed them, they\\nwent into the baths and washed themselves. After they had so done and\\nhad anointed themselves with oil, they sat down to table, and drawing\\nfrom a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering of wine to Minerva.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XIX\\n\\n  Achilles is reconciled with Agamemnon, puts on the armour\\n  which Vulcan had made him, and goes out to fight.\\n\\nNOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of\\nOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the\\nships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son\\nfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also of\\nhis followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came among\\nthem she clasped his hand in her own, saying, \"My son, grieve as we may\\nwe must let this man lie, for it is by heaven\\'s will that he has\\nfallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly armour,\\nwhich no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out\\nbravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none\\ndared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to\\nstill greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for he\\nwas glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had made\\nhim. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, he\\nsaid to his mother, \"Mother, the god has given me armour, meet\\nhandiwork for an immortal and such as no-one living could have\\nfashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon\\nthe son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his\\nbody, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\"\\n\\nSilver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, be not disquieted about this\\nmatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome\\nflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle. He\\nmay lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound as\\never, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly;\\nunsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might\\nand main.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she then\\ndropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus, that his\\nbody might suffer no change.\\n\\nThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called on\\nthe Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always at\\nthe ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were\\nabout the ships and served out rations, all came to the place of\\nassembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so\\nlong from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus,\\ncame limping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless they\\ncame, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of\\nall came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of\\nAntenor had struck him with a spear in battle.\\n\\nWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, \"Son of\\nAtreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,\\nwhen we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would have\\nbeen better, had Diana\\'s arrow slain her at the ships on the day when I\\ntook her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an Achaean the\\nless would have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my anger. It\\nhas been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the Achaeans will long\\nindeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let it be, for it is over.\\nIf we have been angry, necessity has schooled our anger. I put it from\\nme: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore, bid the Achaeans arm\\nforthwith that I may go out against the Trojans, and learn whether they\\nwill be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be\\nto rest his knees who may fly my spear when I wield it.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away\\nhis anger.\\n\\nThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the\\nmiddle of the assembly. \"Danaan heroes,\" said he, \"servants of Mars, it\\nis well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not seemly\\nto interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised speaker. Who\\ncan either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest orator will be\\ndisconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus, and do you\\nother Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the Achaeans spoken\\nto me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was not I that did it:\\nJove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in darkness struck me mad when we\\nwere assembled on the day that I took from Achilles the meed that had\\nbeen awarded to him. What could I do? All things are in the hand of\\nheaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove\\'s daughters, shuts men\\'s eyes to\\ntheir destruction. She walks delicately, not on the solid earth, but\\nhovers over the heads of men to make them stumble or to ensnare them.\\n\\n\"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest\\nwhether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him on\\nthe day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair\\ncity of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, \\'Hear me, all\\ngods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day\\nshall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child\\ninto the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him who are\\nof my blood and lineage.\\' Then said Juno all crafty and full of guile,\\n\\'You will play false, and will not hold to your word. Swear me, O\\nOlympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day fall\\nbetween the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell about\\nhim who are of your blood and lineage.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath,\\nto his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high summit\\nof Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that the\\nnoble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with child\\nand in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth though there\\nwas a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena, and\\nkept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of Saturn,\\nand said, \\'Father Jove, lord of the lightning--I have a word for your\\near. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus\\nthe son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well, therefore, that\\nhe should reign over the Argives.\\'\\n\\n\"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught\\nFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she again\\ninvade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then he\\nwhirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down from\\nheaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he was ever\\nangry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel labours\\nthat Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty Hector\\nwas killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time I kept\\nthinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove robbed me\\nof my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much treasure by\\nway of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your people with\\nyou. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you yesterday in your\\ntents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain fight at\\nonce, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship, that you may\\nsee whether what I give you is enough.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you can\\ngive such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them: it is in\\nyour own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not well to tarry\\ntalking about trifles, for there is a deed which is as yet to do.\\nAchilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost, and laying\\nlow the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of you when he\\nis fighting.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses said, \"Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans\\nthus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will be\\nno brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sides\\nwith fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships,\\nfor in this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle the\\nlivelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food;\\nhowever much he may want to fight his strength will fail him before he\\nknows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will grow\\nweary under him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed with\\nmeat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he\\nhas routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them\\nprepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts in presence\\nof the assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied.\\nMoreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that he has never\\ngone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her after the manner\\nof men and women; and do you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind;\\nlet Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with a feast of\\nreconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full. As for you,\\nson of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future; it is no\\ndisgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong in\\nthe first instance.\"\\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Son of Laertes, your words please me\\nwell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would\\nhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name\\nof heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fain fight\\nat once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from my tent\\nand we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge you:\\ntake some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from my tents the\\ngifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the women also;\\nfurthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those that are with the\\nhost, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and to the sun.\"\\n\\nThen said Achilles, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to these\\nmatters at some other season, when there is breathing time and when I\\nam calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those whom Hector\\nson of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain? Let the sons\\nof the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and without food, till we have\\navenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun let them eat\\ntheir fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying dead in my tent, all hacked\\nand hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades are mourning\\nround him. Therefore I can take thought of nothing save only slaughter\\nand blood and the rattle in the throat of the dying.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the\\nAchaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than a little,\\nbut in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater\\nknowledge. Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of\\nwhich men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is war\\'s steward, weighs the\\nupshot, it may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped\\nis far heavier than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should\\nmourn the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick and\\nthreefold continually; when should we have respite from our sorrow? Let\\nus mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but\\nlet those of us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight\\nour foes more fiercely. In that hour let no man hold back, waiting for\\na second summons; such summons shall bode ill for him who is found\\nlagging behind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and loose\\nthe fury of war upon the Trojans.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with Meges\\nson of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes, and\\nMelanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The word\\nwas not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out the seven\\ntripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty metal cauldrons\\nand the twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled in useful\\narts, seven in number, with Briseis, which made eight. Ulysses weighed\\nout the ten talents of gold and then led the way back, while the young\\nAchaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid them in the middle of\\nthe assembly.\\n\\nAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a god\\ncame to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife which he\\nwore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting off some\\nbristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as he did so.\\nThe other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly to hear\\nthe king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and prayed\\nsaying, \"I call Jove the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, I\\ncall also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who dwell below and take\\nvengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that I have laid no hand upon\\nthe girl Briseis, neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise, but that\\nshe has remained in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely may heaven\\nvisit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those who perjure\\nthemselves.\"\\n\\nHe cut the boar\\'s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled it\\nround his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes. Then\\nAchilles also rose and said to the Argives, \"Father Jove, of a truth\\nyou blind men\\'s eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had not else\\nstirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken Briseis from\\nme against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled the destruction of\\nmany an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that we may begin fighting.\"\\n\\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\\nship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to the\\nship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the stable-men\\ndrove the horses in among the others.\\n\\nBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of Patroclus,\\nflung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her breast, her neck,\\nand her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful as a goddess she\\nwept and said, \"Patroclus, dearest friend, when I went hence I left you\\nliving; I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows\\nmultiply upon me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father and\\nmother married me, cut down before our city, and my three own dear\\nbrothers perished with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus,\\neven when Achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes,\\ntold me that I was not to weep, for you said you would make Achilles\\nmarry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, we should have a wedding\\nfeast among the Myrmidons. You were always kind to me and I shall never\\ncease to grieve for you.\"\\n\\nShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making as\\nthough their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was weeping\\nfor her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round Achilles\\nand prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. \"I\\npray you,\" said he, \"if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat\\nnor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even to\\nthe going down of the sun.\"\\n\\nOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of\\nAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who\\nstayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow:\\nbut he would not be comforted till he should have flung himself into\\nthe jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of\\nPatroclus. Then he said--\\n\\n\"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner\\nready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were hasting\\nto fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and drink in\\nmy tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this I could\\nnot know, not even though I were to hear of the death of my father, who\\nis now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who am here\\nfighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake of Helen,\\nnor yet though I should hear that my son is no more--he who is being\\nbrought up in Scyros--if indeed Neoptolemus is still living. Till now I\\nmade sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy away from Argos, while\\nyou were to return to Phthia, bring back my son with you in your own\\nship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen, and the greatness of\\nmy house--for Peleus must surely be either dead, or what little life\\nremains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities of age and ever\\npresent fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of my death.\"\\n\\nHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought\\non what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn looked down\\nwith pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, \"My child, you have\\nquite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of your\\nrecollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss of\\nhis dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner he\\nwill neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar and ambrosia into\\nhis breast, that he may know no hunger.\"\\n\\nWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.\\nShe darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing on\\nhis broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming\\nthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosia\\ninto Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail\\nhim, she went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the\\nchill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne on the keen\\nblasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming helmets, the\\nbossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the ashen spears\\nstream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the whole land was\\nradiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of the tramp of their\\ntreading rose from under their feet. In the midst of them all Achilles\\nput on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire,\\nfor his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus, then, full of fury\\nagainst the Trojans, did he don the gift of the god, the armour that\\nVulcan had made him.\\n\\nFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and next\\nhe did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the silver-studded\\nsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield so\\ngreat and strong that shone afar with a splendour as of the moon. As\\nthe light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a fire in\\ntheir homestead high up among the mountains, but the sailors are\\ncarried out to sea by wind and storm far from the haven where they\\nwould be--even so did the gleam of Achilles\\' wondrous shield strike up\\ninto the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon his\\nhead, from whence it shone like a star, and the golden plumes which\\nVulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved all around\\nit. Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armour to see whether it\\nfitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and it seemed\\nto buoy him up as though it had been wings.\\n\\nHe also drew his father\\'s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so\\ngreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles\\nhad strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash from the\\ntopmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus,\\nfraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied\\nthemselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast\\nabout them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the reins back\\ntowards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind the\\nhorses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armour, resplendent as\\nthe sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he chided with his\\nfather\\'s horses saying, \"Xanthus and Balius, famed offspring of\\nPodarge--this time when we have done fighting be sure and bring your\\ndriver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him\\ndead on the plain as you did Patroclus.\"\\n\\nThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke--for white-armed Juno had\\nendowed him with human speech--and he bowed his head till his mane\\ntouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. \"Dread\\nAchilles,\" said he, \"we will indeed save you now, but the day of your\\ndeath is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be heaven\\nand stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth\\nor slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus of his\\narmour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him as he\\nfought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector. We two\\ncan fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetest of all winds;\\nnevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a man and of a god.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles\\nanswered him in great sadness, saying, \"Why, O Xanthus, do you thus\\nforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to\\nfall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,\\nshall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of\\nfighting.\"\\n\\nSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.']"
