       "['Book XXIII\\n\\nPENELOPE EVENTUALLY RECOGNISES HER HUSBAND--EARLY IN THE MORNING\\nULYSSES, TELEMACHUS, EUMAEUS, AND PHILOETIUS LEAVE THE TOWN.\\n\\nEuryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear\\nhusband had come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet\\nwere nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her\\nhead to speak to her. \"Wake up Penelope, my dear child,\" she exclaimed,\\n\"and see with your own eyes something that you have been wanting this\\nlong time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come home again, and has\\nkilled the suitors who were giving so much trouble in his house, eating\\nup his estate and ill treating his son.\"\\n\\n\"My good nurse,\" answered Penelope, \"you must be mad. The gods sometimes\\nsend some very sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish\\npeople become sensible. This is what they must have been doing to you;\\nfor you always used to be a reasonable person. Why should you thus mock\\nme when I have trouble enough already--talking such nonsense, and waking\\nme up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my eyes and\\nclosed them? I have never slept so soundly from the day my poor husband\\nwent to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back again into the\\nwomen\\'s room; if it had been any one else who had woke me up to bring me\\nsuch absurd news I should have sent her away with a severe scolding. As\\nit is your age shall protect you.\"\\n\\n\"My dear child,\" answered Euryclea, \"I am not mocking you. It is quite\\ntrue as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger\\nwhom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus knew\\nall the time that he was come back, but kept his father\\'s secret that he\\nmight have his revenge on all these wicked people.\"\\n\\nThen Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea,\\nand wept for joy. \"But my dear nurse,\" said she, \"explain this to me;\\nif he has really come home as you say, how did he manage to overcome the\\nwicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always\\nwere?\"\\n\\n\"I was not there,\" answered Euryclea, \"and do not know; I only heard\\nthem groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and huddled\\nup in a corner of the women\\'s room with the doors closed, till your\\nson came to fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found Ulysses\\nstanding over the corpses that were lying on the ground all round him,\\none on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you could have\\nseen him standing there all bespattered with blood and filth, and\\nlooking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled up in the\\ngatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a great fire\\nto purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to call you, so come\\nwith me that you may both be happy together after all; for now at last\\nthe desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband is come home\\nto find both wife and son alive and well, and to take his revenge in his\\nown house on the suitors who behaved so badly to him.\"\\n\\n\"My dear nurse,\" said Penelope, \"do not exult too confidently over all\\nthis. You know how delighted every one would be to see Ulysses come\\nhome--more particularly myself, and the son who has been born to both\\nof us; but what you tell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is\\nangry with the suitors for their great wickedness, and has made an end\\nof them; for they respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor\\npoor, who came near them, and they have come to a bad end in consequence\\nof their iniquity; Ulysses is dead far away from the Achaean land; he\\nwill never return home again.\"\\n\\nThen nurse Euryclea said, \"My child, what are you talking about? but you\\nwere all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband is\\nnever coming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side\\nat this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof; when I was\\nwashing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave him, and I\\nwanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not let me, and\\nclapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and I will make this\\nbargain with you--if I am deceiving you, you may have me killed by the\\nmost cruel death you can think of.\"\\n\\n\"My dear nurse,\" said Penelope, \"however wise you may be you can hardly\\nfathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search of\\nmy son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the man who has\\nkilled them.\"\\n\\nOn this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she\\nconsidered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband and\\nquestion him, or whether she should at once go up to him and embrace\\nhim. When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister, she\\nsat down opposite Ulysses by the fire, against the wall at right angles\\n{180} [to that by which she had entered], while Ulysses sat near one of\\nthe bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and waiting to see what his\\nbrave wife would say to him when she saw him. For a long time she sat\\nsilent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked him full\\nin the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his shabby\\nclothes and failed to recognise him, {181} till Telemachus began to\\nreproach her and said:\\n\\n\"Mother--but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name--why\\ndo you keep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit by his\\nside and begin talking to him and asking him questions? No other woman\\ncould bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back to her\\nafter twenty years of absence, and after having gone through so much;\\nbut your heart always was as hard as a stone.\"\\n\\nPenelope answered, \"My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can find\\nno words in which either to ask questions or to answer them. I cannot\\neven look him straight in the face. Still, if he really is Ulysses\\ncome back to his own home again, we shall get to understand one another\\nbetter by and by, for there are tokens with which we two are alone\\nacquainted, and which are hidden from all others.\"\\n\\nUlysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, \"Let your mother put me\\nto any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently.\\nShe rejects me for the moment and believes me to be somebody else,\\nbecause I am covered with dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us,\\nhowever, consider what we had better do next. When one man has killed\\nanother--even though he was not one who would leave many friends to take\\nup his quarrel--the man who has killed him must still say good bye to\\nhis friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing the stay\\nof a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you\\nconsider this matter.\"\\n\\n\"Look to it yourself, father,\" answered Telemachus, \"for they say you\\nare the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other\\nmortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with right good\\nwill, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength holds\\nout.\"\\n\\n\"I will say what I think will be best,\" answered Ulysses. \"First wash\\nand put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room and\\ndress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if\\npeople outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some one going along\\nthe street happens to notice it, they may think there is a wedding in\\nthe house, and no rumours about the death of the suitors will get about\\nin the town, before we can escape to the woods upon my own land. Once\\nthere, we will settle which of the courses heaven vouchsafes us shall\\nseem wisest.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed\\nand put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took\\nhis lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The\\nhouse re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the people\\noutside said, \"I suppose the queen has been getting married at last.\\nShe ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to protect her\\nhusband\\'s property until he comes home.\" {182}\\n\\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had been\\nhappening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Ulysses in his\\nown house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made him look\\ntaller and stronger than before; she also made the hair grow thick on\\nthe top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she\\nglorified him about the head and shoulders just as a skilful workman who\\nhas studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva--and his work is\\nfull of beauty--enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it. He came\\nfrom the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat down opposite\\nhis wife on the seat he had left. \"My dear,\" said he, \"heaven has\\nendowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever yet had. No\\nother woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come\\nback to her after twenty years of absence, and after having gone through\\nso much. But come, nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will sleep alone,\\nfor this woman has a heart as hard as iron.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" answered Penelope, \"I have no wish to set myself up, nor to\\ndepreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very well\\nremember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca.\\nNevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that he\\nhimself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding upon it\\nwith fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets.\"\\n\\nShe said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, \"Wife,\\nI am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Who has been\\ntaking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found it a\\nhard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some god came\\nand helped him to shift it. There is no man living, however strong and\\nin his prime, who could move it from its place, for it is a marvellous\\ncuriosity which I made with my very own hands. There was a young olive\\ngrowing within the precincts of the house, in full vigour, and about as\\nthick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this with strong walls\\nof stone and a roof to cover them, and I made the doors strong and\\nwell-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive tree and left\\nthe stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root upwards and\\nthen worked with carpenter\\'s tools well and skilfully, straightening\\nmy work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it into a bed-prop.\\nI then bored a hole down the middle, and made it the centre-post of my\\nbed, at which I worked till I had finished it, inlaying it with gold and\\nsilver; after this I stretched a hide of crimson leather from one side\\nof it to the other. So you see I know all about it, and I desire to\\nlearn whether it is still there, or whether any one has been removing it\\nby cutting down the olive tree at its roots.\"\\n\\nWhen she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke\\ndown. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck, and\\nkissed him. \"Do not be angry with me Ulysses,\" she cried, \"you, who are\\nthe wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven has denied\\nus the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing old, together; do\\nnot then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace you thus\\nas soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering all the time through fear\\nthat someone might come here and deceive me with a lying story; for\\nthere are many very wicked people going about. Jove\\'s daughter Helen\\nwould never have yielded herself to a man from a foreign country, if she\\nhad known that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and bring her\\nback. Heaven put it in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought\\nto that sin, which has been the source of all our sorrows. Now, however,\\nthat you have convinced me by showing that you know all about our\\nbed (which no human being has ever seen but you and I and a single\\nmaidservant, the daughter of Actor, who was given me by my father on my\\nmarriage, and who keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though I\\nhave been I can mistrust no longer.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and\\nfaithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men who\\nare swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their ship with\\nthe fury of his winds and waves; a few alone reach the land, and these,\\ncovered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves on firm\\nground and out of danger--even so was her husband welcome to her as she\\nlooked upon him, and she could not tear her two fair arms from about\\nhis neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging their sorrow till\\nrosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Minerva determined otherwise, and\\nheld night back in the far west, while she would not suffer Dawn to\\nleave Oceanus, nor to yoke the two steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear\\nher onward to break the day upon mankind.\\n\\nAt last, however, Ulysses said, \"Wife, we have not yet reached the end\\nof our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still to undergo. It\\nis long and difficult, but I must go through with it, for thus the shade\\nof Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when I went down into\\nHades to ask about my return and that of my companions. But now let us\\ngo to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.\"\\n\\n\"You shall go to bed as soon as you please,\" replied Penelope, \"now that\\nthe gods have sent you home to your own good house and to your country.\\nBut as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it, tell me about the\\ntask that lies before you. I shall have to hear about it later, so it is\\nbetter that I should be told at once.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" answered Ulysses, \"why should you press me to tell you?\\nStill, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it. I do\\nnot like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide, carrying\\nan oar, till I came to a country where the people have never heard of\\nthe sea, and do not even mix salt with their food. They know nothing\\nabout ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He gave me this\\ncertain token which I will not hide from you. He said that a wayfarer\\nshould meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing shovel that I had\\non my shoulder. On this, I was to fix my oar in the ground and sacrifice\\na ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune; after which I was to go home and\\noffer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven, one after the other. As for\\nmyself, he said that death should come to me from the sea, and that my\\nlife should ebb away very gently when I was full of years and peace of\\nmind, and my people should bless me. All this, he said, should surely\\ncome to pass.\"\\n\\nAnd Penelope said, \"If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier\\ntime in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite from\\nmisfortune.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches\\nand made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid\\nthem, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the\\nbed chamber woman Eurynome {183} to show Ulysses and Penelope to bed by\\ntorch light. When she had conducted them to their room she went\\nback, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.\\nTelemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and made\\nthe women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep in the\\ncloisters.\\n\\nWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking\\nwith one another. She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing\\nthe house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so many\\nsheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so many casks of wine.\\nUlysses in his turn told her what he had suffered, and how much trouble\\nhe had himself given to other people. He told her everything, and she\\nwas so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till he had\\nended his whole story.\\n\\nHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached the\\nfertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops\\nand how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave\\ncomrades; how he then went on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably and\\nfurthered him on his way, but even so he was not to reach home, for to\\nhis great grief a hurricane carried him out to sea again; how he went on\\nto the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the people destroyed all his\\nships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only. Then he told\\nof cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed to the chill house of\\nHades, to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias, and how he\\nsaw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who bore him and brought\\nhim up when he was a child; how he then heard the wondrous singing of\\nthe Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks and terrible Charybdis\\nand to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed in safety; how his men\\nthen ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how Jove therefore struck the\\nship with his thunderbolts, so that all his men perished together,\\nhimself alone being left alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian\\nisland and the nymph Calypso, who kept him there in a cave, and fed\\nhim, and wanted him to marry her, in which case she intended making him\\nimmortal so that he should never grow old, but she could not persuade\\nhim to let her do so; and how after much suffering he had found his way\\nto the Phaeacians, who had treated him as though he had been a god, and\\nsent him back in a ship to his own country after having given him gold,\\nbronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the last thing about\\nwhich he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased\\nthe burden of his sorrows.\\n\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that\\nUlysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned\\nDawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On\\nthis, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope,\\n\"Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here, in\\nlamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home though\\nI was longing all the time to do so. Now, however, that we have at last\\ncome together, take care of the property that is in the house. As for\\nthe sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will take\\nmany myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to\\nmake good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now\\ngoing to the wooded lands out in the country to see my father who has\\nso long been grieved on my account, and to yourself I will give these\\ninstructions, though you have little need of them. At sunrise it will\\nat once get abroad that I have been killing the suitors; go upstairs,\\ntherefore, {184} and stay there with your women. See nobody and ask no\\nquestions.\" {185}\\n\\nAs he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus,\\nPhiloetius, and Eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also.\\nThis they did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they\\nopened the gates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now\\ndaylight, but Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led\\nthem quickly out of the town.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XXII\\n\\n  The death of Hector.\\n\\nTHUS the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat from\\noff them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the goodly\\nbattlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon their\\nshoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hector stay\\nwhere he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then Phoebus Apollo\\nspoke to the son of Peleus saying, \"Why, son of Peleus, do you, who are\\nbut man, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not yet found out\\nthat it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did not harass the\\nTrojans whom you had routed, and now they are within their walls, while\\nyou have been decoyed hither away from them. Me you cannot kill, for\\ndeath can take no hold upon me.\"\\n\\nAchilles was greatly angered and said, \"You have baulked me,\\nFar-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from the\\nwall, where many another man would have bitten the dust ere he got\\nwithin Ilius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved the\\nTrojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but I\\nwould indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so.\"\\n\\nOn this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the winning\\nhorse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is flying over the\\nplain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of Achilles bear him\\nonwards. King Priam was first to note him as he scoured the plain, all\\nradiant as the star which men call Orion\\'s Hound, and whose beams blaze\\nforth in time of harvest more brilliantly than those of any other that\\nshines by night; brightest of them all though he be, he yet bodes ill\\nfor mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train--even so did\\nAchilles\\' armour gleam on his breast as he sped onwards. Priam raised a\\ncry and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them up and shouted\\nout to his dear son, imploring him to return; but Hector still stayed\\nbefore the gates, for his heart was set upon doing battle with\\nAchilles. The old man reached out his arms towards him and bade him for\\npity\\'s sake come within the walls. \"Hector,\" he cried, \"my son, stay\\nnot to face this man alone and unsupported, or you will meet death at\\nthe hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier than you. Monster\\nthat he is; would indeed that the gods loved him no better than I do,\\nfor so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched on\\nearth, and a load of grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a\\nbrave son has he reft from me, either by killing them or selling them\\naway in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons\\nfrom among the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lycaon and\\nPolydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they be\\nstill alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them with\\ngold and bronze, of which we have store, for the old man Altes endowed\\nhis daughter richly; but if they are already dead and in the house of\\nHades, sorrow will it be to us two who were their parents; albeit the\\ngrief of others will be more short-lived unless you too perish at the\\nhands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the city, to be the\\nguardian of Trojan men and Trojan women, or you will both lose your own\\nlife and afford a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Have pity also\\non your unhappy father while life yet remains to him--on me, whom the\\nson of Saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on the threshold of old\\nage, after I have seen my sons slain and my daughters haled away as\\ncaptives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little children dashed to earth\\namid the rage of battle, and my sons\\' wives dragged away by the cruel\\nhands of the Achaeans; in the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces\\nat my own gates after some one has beaten the life out of my body with\\nsword or spear-hounds that I myself reared and fed at my own table to\\nguard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood and then lie all\\ndistraught at my doors. When a young man falls by the sword in battle,\\nhe may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be\\nseen, all is honourable in death, but when an old man is slain there is\\nnothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile his\\ngrey hair and beard and all that men hide for shame.\"\\n\\nThe old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the heart\\nof Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she bared her\\nbosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. \"Hector,\" she\\ncried, weeping bitterly the while, \"Hector, my son, spurn not this\\nbreast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfort\\nfrom my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wall\\nto protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should the\\nwretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall ever\\nweep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogs\\nwill devour you at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nThus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved not\\nthe heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge Achilles as\\nhe drew nearer towards him. As a serpent in its den upon the mountains,\\nfull fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach of man--he is\\nfilled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes writhing round\\nhis den--even so Hector leaned his shield against a tower that jutted\\nout from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted.\\n\\n\"Alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, \"if I go\\nwithin the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon me,\\nfor it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the city on\\nthat awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would not\\nlisten, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Now that\\nmy folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men and Trojan\\nwomen in the face, lest a worse man should say, \\'Hector has ruined us\\nby his self-confidence.\\' Surely it would be better for me to return\\nafter having fought Achilles and slain him, or to die gloriously here\\nbefore the city. What, again, if I were to lay down my shield and\\nhelmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight up to noble\\nAchilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen, who was the\\nfountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that Alexandrus\\nbrought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let the Achaeans\\ndivide the half of everything that the city contains among themselves?\\nI might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their princes, take a solemn\\noath that they would hide nothing, but would divide into two shares all\\nthat is within the city--but why argue with myself in this way? Were I\\nto go up to him he would show me no kind of mercy; he would kill me\\nthen and there as easily as though I were a woman, when I had off my\\narmour. There is no parleying with him from some rock or oak tree as\\nyoung men and maidens prattle with one another. Better fight him at\\nonce, and learn to which of us Jove will vouchsafe victory.\"\\n\\nThus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it were\\nMars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder he\\nbrandished his terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamed\\naround him like flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fell\\nupon Hector as he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he was\\nbut fled in dismay from before the gates, while Achilles darted after\\nhim at his utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds,\\nswoops down upon some cowering dove--the dove flies before him but the\\nfalcon with a shrill scream follows close after, resolved to have\\nher--even so did Achilles make straight for Hector with all his might,\\nwhile Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take\\nhim.\\n\\nOn they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the wall,\\npast the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild fig-tree,\\ntill they came to two fair springs which feed the river Scamander. One\\nof these two springs is warm, and steam rises from it as smoke from a\\nburning fire, but the other even in summer is as cold as hail or snow,\\nor the ice that forms on water. Here, hard by the springs, are the\\ngoodly washing-troughs of stone, where in the time of peace before the\\ncoming of the Achaeans the wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used\\nto wash their clothes. Past these did they fly, the one in front and\\nthe other giving chase behind him: good was the man that fled, but\\nbetter far was he that followed after, and swiftly indeed did they run,\\nfor the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice or bullock\\'s hide, as it\\nmight be for a common foot-race, but they ran for the life of Hector.\\nAs horses in a chariot race speed round the turning-posts when they are\\nrunning for some great prize--a tripod or woman--at the games in honour\\nof some dead hero, so did these two run full speed three times round\\nthe city of Priam. All the gods watched them, and the sire of gods and\\nmen was the first to speak.\\n\\n\"Alas,\" said he, \"my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being pursued\\nround the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for Hector, who has\\nburned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honour, one while on the\\ncrests of many-valleyed Ida, and again on the citadel of Troy; and now\\nI see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him round the city of Priam.\\nWhat say you? Consider among yourselves and decide whether we shall now\\nsave him or let him fall, valiant though he be, before Achilles, son of\\nPeleus.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud and\\nstorm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doom has long\\nbeen decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we others\\nshall not be of a mind with you.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not speak\\nin full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do without let or\\nhindrance as you are minded.\"\\n\\nThus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she darted\\nfrom the topmost summits of Olympus.\\n\\nAchilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing a fawn\\nwhich he has started from its covert on the mountains, and hunts\\nthrough glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by crouching\\nunder cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her up\\nuntil he gets her--even so there was no escape for Hector from the\\nfleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian\\ngates and under the walls, that his people might help him by showering\\ndown weapons from above, Achilles would gain on him and head him back\\ntowards the plain, keeping himself always on the city side. As a man in\\na dream who fails to lay hands upon another whom he is pursuing--the\\none cannot escape nor the other overtake--even so neither could\\nAchilles come up with Hector, nor Hector break away from Achilles;\\nnevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not the time come\\nwhen Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved his\\nrunning, was now no longer to stay by him. Achilles made signs to the\\nAchaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to aim a dart\\nat Hector, lest another might win the glory of having hit him and he\\nmight himself come in second. Then, at last, as they were nearing the\\nfountains for the fourth time, the father of all balanced his golden\\nscales and placed a doom in each of them, one for Achilles and the\\nother for Hector. As he held the scales by the middle, the doom of\\nHector fell down deep into the house of Hades--and then Phoebus Apollo\\nleft him. Thereon Minerva went close up to the son of Peleus and said,\\n\"Noble Achilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to\\nthe ships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his\\nlust of battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling before his\\nfather, aegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer. Stay here\\nand take breath, while I go up to him and persuade him to make a stand\\nand fight you.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still,\\nleaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left him and\\nwent after Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. She came\\nclose up to him and said, \"Dear brother, I see you are hard pressed by\\nAchilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city of Priam, let\\nus await his onset and stand on our defence.\"\\n\\nAnd Hector answered, \"Deiphobus, you have always been dearest to me of\\nall my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforth I shall\\nrate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured outside the\\nwall for my sake when all the others remain inside.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Dear brother, my father and mother went down on\\ntheir knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain inside,\\nso great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an agony of\\ngrief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a stand and\\nfight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve, that we may\\nlearn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off our spoils to the\\nships, or whether he shall fall before you.\"\\n\\nThus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two were now\\nclose to one another great Hector was first to speak. \"I will no longer\\nfly you, son of Peleus,\" said he, \"as I have been doing hitherto. Three\\ntimes have I fled round the mighty city of Priam, without daring to\\nwithstand you, but now, let me either slay or be slain, for I am in the\\nmind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to one another by our\\ngods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardians of all covenants; let\\nit be agreed between us that if Jove vouchsafes me the longer stay and\\nI take your life, I am not to treat your dead body in any unseemly\\nfashion, but when I have stripped you of your armour, I am to give up\\nyour body to the Achaeans. And do you likewise.\"\\n\\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Fool, prate not to me about\\ncovenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves and\\nlambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out all\\nthrough. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and me,\\nnor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall fall\\nand glut grim Mars with his life\\'s blood. Put forth all your strength;\\nyou have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldier and man of\\nwar. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva will forthwith\\nvanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full for the grief\\nyou have caused me on account of my comrades whom you have killed in\\nbattle.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it coming and\\navoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew over his\\nhead and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it up and\\ngave it back to Achilles without Hector\\'s seeing her; Hector thereon\\nsaid to the son of Peleus, \"You have missed your aim, Achilles, peer of\\nthe gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you the hour of my doom,\\nthough you made sure that he had done so. You were a false-tongued liar\\nwhen you deemed that I should forget my valour and quail before you.\\nYou shall not drive your spear into the back of a runaway--drive it,\\nshould heaven so grant you power, drive it into me as I make straight\\ntowards you; and now for your own part avoid my spear if you can--would\\nthat you might receive the whole of it into your body; if you were once\\ndead the Trojans would find the war an easier matter, for it is you who\\nhave harmed them most.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true for he\\nhit the middle of Achilles\\' shield, but the spear rebounded from it,\\nand did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw that the weapon had\\nsped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had no\\nsecond spear. With a loud cry he called Deiphobus and asked him for\\none, but there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to himself,\\n\"Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. I deemed that the\\nhero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within the wall, and Minerva\\nhas inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and\\nthere is no way out of it--for so Jove and his son Apollo the\\nfar-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready\\nto protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die\\ningloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great\\nthing that shall be told among men hereafter.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong by his\\nside, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles like a\\nsoaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb or\\ntimid hare--even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon\\nAchilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrous\\nshield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with four\\nlayers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. The thick tresses of gold\\nwith which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as the\\nevening star that shines brighter than all others through the stillness\\nof night, even such was the gleam of the spear which Achilles poised in\\nhis right hand, fraught with the death of noble Hector. He eyed his\\nfair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound it, but all\\nwas protected by the goodly armour of which Hector had spoiled\\nPatroclus after he had slain him, save only the throat where the\\ncollar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders, and this is a most\\ndeadly place: here then did Achilles strike him as he was coming on\\ntowards him, and the point of his spear went right through the fleshy\\npart of the neck, but it did not sever his windpipe so that he could\\nstill speak. Hector fell headlong, and Achilles vaunted over him\\nsaying, \"Hector, you deemed that you should come off scatheless when\\nyou were spoiling Patroclus, and recked not of myself who was not with\\nhim. Fool that you were: for I, his comrade, mightier far than he, was\\nstill left behind him at the ships, and now I have laid you low. The\\nAchaeans shall give him all due funeral rites, while dogs and vultures\\nshall work their will upon yourself.\"\\n\\nThen Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, \"I pray you by your\\nlife and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me at the\\nships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and bronze\\nwhich my father and mother will offer you, and send my body home, that\\nthe Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when I am dead.\"\\n\\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Dog, talk not to me neither of\\nknees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able to cut\\nyour flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill you have done me, as\\nI am that nothing shall save you from the dogs--it shall not be, though\\nthey bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me on the\\nspot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son of Dardanus\\nshould bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so your mother shall\\nnever lay you out and make lament over the son she bore, but dogs and\\nvultures shall eat you utterly up.\"\\n\\nHector with his dying breath then said, \"I know you what you are, and\\nwas sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard as iron;\\nlook to it that I bring not heaven\\'s anger upon you on the day when\\nParis and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you at the\\nScaean gates.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon his\\nsoul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamenting its\\nsad fate that it should enjoy youth and strength no longer. But\\nAchilles said, speaking to the dead body, \"Die; for my part I will\\naccept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send it.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one side;\\nthen he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector\\'s shoulders while\\nthe other Achaeans came running up to view his wondrous strength and\\nbeauty; and no one came near him without giving him a fresh wound. Then\\nwould one turn to his neighbour and say, \"It is easier to handle Hector\\nnow than when he was flinging fire on to our ships\"--and as he spoke he\\nwould thrust his spear into him anew.\\n\\nWhen Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood among\\nthe Argives and said, \"My friends, princes and counsellors of the\\nArgives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, who\\nhas done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether we\\nshould not attack the city in force, and discover in what mind the\\nTrojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will desert their\\ncity now that Hector has fallen, or will still hold out even though he\\nis no longer living. But why argue with myself in this way, while\\nPatroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, and unmourned--he whom\\nI can never forget so long as I am alive and my strength fails not?\\nThough men forget their dead when once they are within the house of\\nHades, yet not even there will I forget the comrade whom I have lost.\\nNow, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise the song of victory and go\\nback to the ships taking this man along with us; for we have achieved a\\nmighty triumph and have slain noble Hector to whom the Trojans prayed\\nthroughout their city as though he were a god.\"\\n\\nOn this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced the\\nsinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passed\\nthongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the body\\nfast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground. Then when\\nhe had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself mounted, he\\nlashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth. The dust rose\\nfrom Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew all\\nabroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on earth, for Jove had\\nnow delivered him into the hands of his foes to do him outrage in his\\nown land.\\n\\nThus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His mother\\ntore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as she\\nlooked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and throughout the\\ncity the people fell to weeping and wailing. It was as though the whole\\nof frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire. Hardly could the people\\nhold Priam back in his hot haste to rush without the gates of the city.\\nHe grovelled in the mire and besought them, calling each one of them by\\nhis name. \"Let be, my friends,\" he cried, \"and for all your sorrow,\\nsuffer me to go single-handed to the ships of the Achaeans. Let me\\nbeseech this cruel and terrible man, if maybe he will respect the\\nfeeling of his fellow-men, and have compassion on my old age. His own\\nfather is even such another as myself--Peleus, who bred him and reared\\nhim to be the bane of us Trojans, and of myself more than of all\\nothers. Many a son of mine has he slain in the flower of his youth, and\\nyet, grieve for these as I may, I do so for one--Hector--more than for\\nthem all, and the bitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to the\\nhouse of Hades. Would that he had died in my arms, for so both his\\nill-starred mother who bore him, and myself, should have had the\\ncomfort of weeping and mourning over him.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city\\njoined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among the\\nTrojans. \"Alas, my son,\" she cried, \"what have I left to live for now\\nthat you are no more? Night and day did I glory in you throughout the\\ncity, for you were a tower of strength to all in Troy, and both men and\\nwomen alike hailed you as a god. So long as you lived you were their\\npride, but now death and destruction have fallen upon you.\"\\n\\nHector\\'s wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to tell her\\nthat her husband had remained without the gates. She was at her loom in\\nan inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web, and\\nembroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set a large\\ntripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hector when he\\ncame out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now beyond the\\nreach of baths, and that Minerva had laid him low by the hands of\\nAchilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, and trembled in\\nevery limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again she spoke to her\\nwaiting-women. \"Two of you,\" she said, \"come with me that I may learn\\nwhat it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my husband\\'s\\nhonoured mother; my own heart beats as though it would come into my\\nmouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great misfortune for\\nPriam\\'s children must be at hand. May I never live to hear it, but I\\ngreatly fear that Achilles has cut off the retreat of brave Hector and\\nhas chased him on to the plain where he was singlehanded; I fear he may\\nhave put an end to the reckless daring which possessed my husband, who\\nwould never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far in\\nfront, foremost of them all in valour.\"\\n\\nHer heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like a\\nmaniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached the\\nbattlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon the\\nwall, and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city--the horses\\ndragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the ships of\\nthe Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness of night\\nand she fell fainting backwards. She tore the attiring from her head\\nand flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaited band, and\\nthe veil which golden Venus had given her on the day when Hector took\\nher with him from the house of Eetion, after having given countless\\ngifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband\\'s sisters and the wives of\\nhis brothers crowded round her and supported her, for she was fain to\\ndie in her distraction; when she again presently breathed and came to\\nherself, she sobbed and made lament among the Trojans saying, \"Woe is\\nme, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common lot we were born, you\\nat Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes under the wooded\\nmountain of Placus in the house of Eetion who brought me up when I was\\na child--ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter--would that he had\\nnever begotten me. You are now going into the house of Hades under the\\nsecret places of the earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your\\nhouse. The child, of whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet\\na mere infant. Now that you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for\\nhim nor he for you. Even though he escape the horrors of this woeful\\nwar with the Achaeans, yet shall his life henceforth be one of labour\\nand sorrow, for others will seize his lands. The day that robs a child\\nof his parents severs him from his own kind; his head is bowed, his\\ncheeks are wet with tears, and he will go about destitute among the\\nfriends of his father, plucking one by the cloak and another by the\\nshirt. Some one or other of these may so far pity him as to hold the\\ncup for a moment towards him and let him moisten his lips, but he must\\nnot drink enough to wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose parents\\nare alive will drive him from the table with blows and angry words.\\n\\'Out with you,\\' he will say, \\'you have no father here,\\' and the child\\nwill go crying back to his widowed mother--he, Astyanax, who erewhile\\nwould sit upon his father\\'s knees, and have none but the daintiest and\\nchoicest morsels set before him. When he had played till he was tired\\nand went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, on\\na soft couch, knowing neither want nor care, whereas now that he has\\nlost his father his lot will be full of hardship--he, whom the Trojans\\nname Astyanax, because you, O Hector, were the only defence of their\\ngates and battlements. The wriggling writhing worms will now eat you at\\nthe ships, far from your parents, when the dogs have glutted themselves\\nupon you. You will lie naked, although in your house you have fine and\\ngoodly raiment made by hands of women. This will I now burn; it is of\\nno use to you, for you can never again wear it, and thus you will have\\nrespect shown you by the Trojans both men and women.\"\\n\\nIn such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women joined in\\nher lament.']"

       "['Book X\\n\\nAEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.\\n\\n\"Thence we went on to the Aeolian island where lives Aeolus son of\\nHippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as\\nit were) upon the sea, {83} iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now,\\nAeolus has six daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry\\nthe daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,\\nfeasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long the\\natmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats till\\nit groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well\\nmade bedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets. These were\\nthe people among whom we had now come.\\n\\n\"Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the\\ntime about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. I\\ntold him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must go,\\nand asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of difficulty,\\nbut set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me a prime ox-hide\\nto hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut up in the hide as\\nin a sack--for Jove had made him captain over the winds, and he could\\nstir or still each one of them according to his own pleasure. He put\\nthe sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly with a silver thread\\nthat not even a breath of a side-wind could blow from any quarter. The\\nWest wind which was fair for us did he alone let blow as it chose; but\\nit all came to nothing, for we were lost through our own folly.\\n\\n\"Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native\\nland showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could see the\\nstubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell into a light\\nsleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we might\\nget home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among themselves,\\nand said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that Aeolus\\nhad given me. \\'Bless my heart,\\' would one turn to his neighbour, saying,\\n\\'how this man gets honoured and makes friends to whatever city or\\ncountry he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking home from Troy,\\nwhile we, who have travelled just as far as he has, come back with hands\\nas empty as we set out with--and now Aeolus has given him ever so much\\nmore. Quick--let us see what it all is, and how much gold and silver\\nthere is in the sack he gave him.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,\\nwhereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried us\\nweeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and knew\\nnot whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make the best\\nof it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the ship, while\\nthe men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet back to the\\nAeolian island.\\n\\n\"When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard by\\nthe ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of my men\\nand went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting\\nwith his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the threshold.\\nThey were astounded when they saw us and said, \\'Ulysses, what brings you\\nhere? What god has been ill-treating you? We took great pains to further\\nyou on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever it was that you wanted to go\\nto.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, \\'My men have undone\\nme; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this\\nmischief, for you can if you will.\\'\\n\\n\"I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their\\nfather answered, \\'Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the\\nisland; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for you\\ncome here as one abhorred of heaven.\\' And with these words he sent me\\nsorrowing from his door.\\n\\n\"Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and\\nfruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six\\ndays, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the\\nrocky stronghold of Lamus--Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians,\\nwhere the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked]\\nsalutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last answers\\nthe salute. In that country a man who could do without sleep might earn\\ndouble wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd,\\nfor they work much the same by night as they do by day. {84}\\n\\n\"When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep cliffs,\\nwith a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took all their\\nships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for there was\\nnever so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always dead calm. I\\nkept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the very end of the\\npoint; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoitre, but could see no sign\\nneither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising from the ground. So I\\nsent two of my company with an attendant to find out what sort of people\\nthe inhabitants were.\\n\\n\"The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the\\npeople draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till\\npresently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water,\\nand who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going\\nto the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their water, and\\nwhen my men had come close up to her, they asked her who the king of\\nthat country might be, and over what kind of people he ruled; so she\\ndirected them to her father\\'s house, but when they got there they found\\nhis wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and they were horrified\\nat the sight of her.\\n\\n\"She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly,\\nand forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them,\\nand began to make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other\\ntwo ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates\\nraised a hue-and-cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians\\nsprang up from every quarter--ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at\\nus from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard\\nthe horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and the\\ndeath cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes\\nand took them home to eat them. While they were thus killing my men\\nwithin the harbour I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and\\ntold my men to row with all their might if they too would not fare like\\nthe rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful enough\\nwhen we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us.\\nAs for the others there was not one of them left.\\n\\n\"Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we had\\nlost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe lives--a\\ngreat and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician Aeetes--for\\nthey are both children of the sun by Perse, who is daughter to Oceanus.\\nWe brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word, for some god\\nguided us thither, and having landed we lay there for two days and two\\nnights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning of the third day\\ncame I took my spear and my sword, and went away from the ship to\\nreconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human handiwork,\\nor hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a high look-out I\\nespied the smoke of Circe\\'s house rising upwards amid a dense forest of\\ntrees, and when I saw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I\\nwould not go on at once and find out more, but in the end I deemed it\\nbest to go back to the ship, give the men their dinners, and send some\\nof them instead of going myself.\\n\\n\"When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my\\nsolitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my\\npath. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the\\nriver, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck\\nhim in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean\\nthrough him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of\\nhim. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and laid\\nit down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them into a\\nfathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the four feet of\\nthe noble creature together; having so done I hung him round my neck and\\nwalked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag was much too\\nbig for me to be able to carry him on my shoulder, steadying him with\\none hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship, I called the men\\nand spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them. \\'Look here my friends,\\'\\nsaid I, \\'we are not going to die so much before our time after all, and\\nat any rate we will not starve so long as we have got something to eat\\nand drink on board.\\' On this they uncovered their heads upon the sea\\nshore and admired the stag, for he was indeed a splendid fellow. Then,\\nwhen they had feasted their eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed\\ntheir hands and began to cook him for dinner.\\n\\n\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed\\nthere eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and it\\ncame on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning,\\nrosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, \\'My friends,\\nwe are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have no\\nidea where the sun either sets or rises, {85} so that we do not even\\nknow East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless, we must try\\nand find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high as\\nI could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to the\\nhorizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out\\nof a thick forest of trees.\\'\\n\\n\"Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they had\\nbeen treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre\\nPolyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing to\\nbe got by crying, so I divided them into two companies and set a captain\\nover each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while I took command of\\nthe other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot fell upon\\nEurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two men, and they wept, as\\nalso did we who were left behind.\\n\\n\"When they reached Circe\\'s house they found it built of cut stones, on\\na site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest.\\nThere were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it--poor\\nbewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged\\ninto subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged their great\\ntails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against them.\\n{86} As hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming from\\ndinner--for they know he will bring them something--even so did these\\nwolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the men\\nwere terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures. Presently\\nthey reached the gates of the goddess\\'s house, and as they stood there\\nthey could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked at\\nher loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colours\\nas no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued and\\ntrusted more than any other of my men, said, \\'There is some one inside\\nworking at a loom and singing most beautifully; the whole place resounds\\nwith it, let us call her and see whether she is woman or goddess.\\'\\n\\n\"They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them\\nenter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who\\nsuspected mischief and staid outside. When she had got them into her\\nhouse, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with\\ncheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked\\npoisons to make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she\\nturned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her\\npig-styes. They were like pigs--head, hair, and all, and they grunted\\njust as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before, and they\\nremembered everything.\\n\\n\"Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some acorns\\nand beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back to tell me\\nabout the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with dismay\\nthat though he tried to speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes\\nfilled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till at last we forced\\nhis story out of him, and he told us what had happened to the others.\\n\\n\"\\'We went,\\' said he, \\'as you told us, through the forest, and in the\\nmiddle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place\\nthat could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was a\\ngoddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to\\nher and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door, and\\ninvited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they followed\\nher into the house, but I staid where I was, for I thought there might\\nbe some treachery. From that moment I saw them no more, for not one of\\nthem ever came out, though I sat a long time watching for them.\\'\\n\\n\"Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also\\ntook my bow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and shew me the\\nway. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously,\\nsaying, \\'Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me stay here, for\\nI know you will not bring one of them back with you, nor even return\\nalive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any rate with\\nthe few that are left us, for we may still save our lives.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Stay where you are, then,\\' answered I, \\'eating and drinking at the\\nship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.\\'\\n\\n\"With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the\\ncharmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe,\\nI met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the\\nhey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his\\nface. He came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying, \\'My poor\\nunhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top, alone and\\nwithout knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe\\'s pigstyes, like\\nso many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not fancy that you can\\nset them free? I can tell you that you will never get back and will have\\nto stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will protect\\nyou and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which is one\\nof great virtue, and keep it about you when you go to Circe\\'s house, it\\nwill be a talisman to you against every kind of mischief.\\n\\n\"\\'And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try\\nto practice upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and she will\\ndrug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to charm\\nyou, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you will prevent her\\nspells from working. I will tell you all about it. When Circe strikes\\nyou with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon her as though you\\nwere going to kill her. She will then be frightened, and will desire you\\nto go to bed with her; on this you must not point blank refuse her, for\\nyou want her to set your companions free, and to take good care also of\\nyourself, but you must make her swear solemnly by all the blessed gods\\nthat she will plot no further mischief against you, or else when she has\\ngot you naked she will unman you and make you fit for nothing.\\'\\n\\n\"As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground and shewed me what it\\nwas like. The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk; the\\ngods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods can do\\nwhatever they like.\\n\\n\"Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island;\\nbut I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with\\ncare as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and called\\nthe goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came down, opened the door,\\nand asked me to come in; so I followed her--much troubled in my mind.\\nShe set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver, there was a\\nfootstool also under my feet, and she mixed a mess in a golden goblet\\nfor me to drink; but she drugged it, for she meant me mischief. When she\\nhad given it me, and I had drunk it without its charming me, she struck\\nme with her wand. \\'There now,\\' she cried, \\'be off to the pigstye, and\\nmake your lair with the rest of them.\\'\\n\\n\"But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her,\\nwhereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke\\npiteously, saying, \\'Who and whence are you? from what place and people\\nhave you come? How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?\\nNever yet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I\\ngave you; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other than the\\nbold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always said would come here some day with\\nhis ship while on his way home from Troy; so be it then; sheathe your\\nsword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends and learn to trust\\neach other.\\'\\n\\n\"And I answered, \\'Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with you\\nwhen you have just been turning all my men into pigs? And now that you\\nhave got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me to go to\\nbed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I shall\\ncertainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will first take\\nyour solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.\\'\\n\\n\"So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had completed her\\noath then I went to bed with her.\\n\\n\"Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about their\\nwork. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and of the\\nholy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a fair purple\\ncloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. Another brought\\ntables of silver up to the seats, and set them with baskets of gold. A\\nthird mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put golden\\ncups upon the tables, while the fourth brought in water and set it to\\nboil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted. When\\nthe water in the cauldron was boiling, {87} she poured cold into it\\ntill it was just as I liked it, and then she set me in a bath and began\\nwashing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders, to take the\\ntire and stiffness out of my limbs. As soon as she had done washing me\\nand anointing me with oil, she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt\\nand led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a\\nfootstool also under my feet. A maid servant then brought me water in a\\nbeautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash\\nmy hands, and she drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant brought\\nme bread and offered me many things of what there was in the house, and\\nthen Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without heeding what\\nwas before me, still moody and suspicious.\\n\\n\"When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief, she\\ncame to me and said, \\'Ulysses, why do you sit like that as though you\\nwere dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and drink?\\nIs it that you are still suspicious? You ought not to be, for I have\\nalready sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.\\'\\n\\n\"And I said, \\'Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can think of\\neither eating or drinking in your house until you have set his friends\\nfree and let him see them. If you want me to eat and drink, you must\\nfree my men and bring them to me that I may see them with my own eyes.\\'\\n\\n\"When I had said this she went straight through the court with her wand\\nin her hand and opened the pigstye doors. My men came out like so many\\nprime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among them and\\nanointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that the bad drug\\nhad given them fell off, and they became men again, younger than they\\nwere before, and much taller and better looking. They knew me at once,\\nseized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till the whole\\nhouse was filled with the sound of their halloa-ballooing, and Circe\\nherself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and said, \\'Ulysses,\\nnoble son of Laertes, go back at once to the sea where you have left\\nyour ship, and first draw it on to the land. Then, hide all your ship\\'s\\ngear and property in some cave, and come back here with your men.\\'\\n\\n\"I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the men at\\nthe ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me the silly\\nblubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break out and\\ngambol round their mothers, when they see them coming home to be milked\\nafter they have been feeding all day, and the homestead resounds with\\ntheir lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though they had got back\\nto their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been born and bred. \\'Sir,\\'\\nsaid the affectionate creatures, \\'we are as glad to see you back as\\nthough we had got safe home to Ithaca; but tell us all about the fate of\\nour comrades.\\'\\n\\n\"I spoke comfortingly to them and said, \\'We must draw our ship on to the\\nland, and hide the ship\\'s gear with all our property in some cave; then\\ncome with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe\\'s house, where\\nyou will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great\\nabundance.\\'\\n\\n\"On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried\\nto hold them back and said, \\'Alas, poor wretches that we are, what will\\nbecome of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of Circe, who\\nwill turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to\\nkeep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us when our\\ncomrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. It was all through\\nhis sheer folly that those men lost their lives.\\'\\n\\n\"When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen\\nblade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of\\nhis being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him\\nand said, \\'Sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here and mind the\\nship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe\\'s house.\\'\\n\\n\"On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after\\nall, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand that\\nI had given him.\\n\\n\"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left behind\\nwere washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given them woollen\\ncloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all comfortably at\\ndinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other face to face\\nand knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud till the whole\\npalace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me and said, \\'Ulysses, noble\\nson of Laertes, tell your men to leave off crying; I know how much you\\nhave all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you have fared among cruel\\nsavages on the mainland, but that is over now, so stay here, and eat and\\ndrink till you are once more as strong and hearty as you were when you\\nleft Ithaca; for at present you are weakened both in body and mind; you\\nkeep all the time thinking of the hardships you have suffered during\\nyour travels, so that you have no more cheerfulness left in you.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole\\ntwelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But\\nwhen the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days had\\ncome round, my men called me apart and said, \\'Sir, it is time you began\\nto think about going home, if so be you are to be spared to see your\\nhouse and native country at all.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day to\\nthe going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but when\\nthe sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down to\\nsleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into bed\\nwith Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened to what\\nI had got to say. \\'Circe,\\' said I, \\'please to keep the promise you made\\nme about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get back and so\\ndo my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon as\\never your back is turned.\\'\\n\\n\"And the goddess answered, \\'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall\\nnone of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there\\nis another journey which you have got to take before you can sail\\nhomewards. You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine to\\nconsult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias, whose reason is\\nstill unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine left his understanding even\\nin death, but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.\\'\\n\\n\"I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would\\ngladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently\\nwhen I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, \\'And who\\nshall guide me upon this voyage--for the house of Hades is a port that\\nno ship can reach.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'You will want no guide,\\' she answered; \\'raise your mast, set your\\nwhite sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there\\nof itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will\\nreach the fertile shore of Proserpine\\'s country with its groves of tall\\npoplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your\\nship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark abode of\\nHades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon\\nand Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron, and\\nyou will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring rivers run into\\none another.\\n\\n\"\\'When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench\\na cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a\\ndrink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine,\\nand in the third place water--sprinkling white barley meal over the\\nwhole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble ghosts,\\nand promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will sacrifice a\\nbarren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load the pyre with\\ngood things. More particularly you must promise that Teiresias shall\\nhave a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all your flocks.\\n\\n\"\\'When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer\\nthem a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but\\nyourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the river.\\nOn this, many dead men\\'s ghosts will come to you, and you must tell your\\nmen to skin the two sheep that you have just killed, and offer them as a\\nburnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades and to Proserpine. Then draw your\\nsword and sit there, so as to prevent any other poor ghost from\\ncoming near the spilt blood before Teiresias shall have answered your\\nquestions. The seer will presently come to you, and will tell you about\\nyour voyage--what stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the\\nsea so as to reach your home.\\'\\n\\n\"It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed\\nme in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light\\ngossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle\\nround her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went\\nabout among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly to\\neach of them man by man: \\'You must not lie sleeping here any longer,\\'\\nsaid I to them, \\'we must be going, for Circe has told me all about it.\\'\\nAnd on this they did as I bade them.\\n\\n\"Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had\\nwith us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or\\ncourage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from the\\nrest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the\\nnoise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot\\nall about coming down by the main staircase, so he tumbled right off the\\nroof and broke his neck, and his soul went down to the house of Hades.\\n\\n\"When I had got the men together I said to them, \\'You think you are\\nabout to start home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead of\\nthis, we have got to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to consult\\nthe ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.\\'\\n\\n\"The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves\\non the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend\\nmatters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting\\nour fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard\\nby the ship. She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it,\\nfor who can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not\\nwish to be seen?',\n",
       " 'BOOK VIII\\n\\n  Jove forbids the gods to interfere further--There is an even\\n  fight till midday, but then Jove inclines the scales of victory\\n  in favour of the Trojans, who eventually chase the Achaeans\\n  within their wall--Juno and Minerva set out to help the\\n  Trojans: Jove sends Iris to turn them back, but later on\\n  he promises Juno that she shall have her way in the end--Hector\\'s\\n  triumph is stayed by nightfall--The Trojans bivouac on the plain.\\n\\nNOW when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuse\\nlight over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on the topmost\\ncrest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gave\\near. \"Hear me,\" said he, \"gods and goddesses, that I may speak even as\\nI am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor god try to cross me,\\nbut obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to an end. If\\nI see anyone acting apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans, he\\nshall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again to Olympus; or I\\nwill hurl him down into dark Tartarus far into the deepest pit under\\nthe earth, where the gates are iron and the floor bronze, as far\\nbeneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, that you may learn how\\nmuch the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find out for yourselves.\\nHangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it all of you,\\ngods and goddesses together--tug as you will, you will not drag Jove\\nthe supreme counsellor from heaven to earth; but were I to pull at it\\nmyself I should draw you up with earth and sea into the bargain, then\\nwould I bind the chain about some pinnacle of Olympus and leave you all\\ndangling in the mid firmament. So far am I above all others either of\\ngods or men.\"\\n\\nThey were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he had\\nspoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, \"Father, son of\\nSaturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to be\\ngainsaid, but we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors, who are\\nperishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid\\nus, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceable\\nsuggestions to the Argives that they may not all of them perish in your\\ndispleasure.\"\\n\\nJove smiled at her and answered, \"Take heart, my child, Trito-born; I\\nam not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to you.\"\\n\\nWith this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and manes of\\nglittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about the body,\\nseized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon he\\nlashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixt earth\\nand starry heaven. After a while he reached many-fountained Ida, mother\\nof wild beasts, and Gargarus, where are his grove and fragrant altar.\\nThere the father of gods and men stayed his horses, took them from the\\nchariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then he took his seat all\\nglorious upon the topmost crests, looking down upon the city of Troy\\nand the ships of the Achaeans.\\n\\nThe Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and\\nafterwards put on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand likewise\\narmed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but nevertheless\\neager perforce to do battle for their wives and children. All the gates\\nwere flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth with the tramp\\nas of a great multitude.\\n\\nWhen they were got together in one place, shield clashed with shield,\\nand spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mighty was the\\ndin as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another--death--cry and\\nshout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with blood.\\n\\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their weapons\\nbeat against one another, and the people fell, but when the sun had\\nreached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his golden scales, and put\\ntwo fates of death within them, one for the Trojans and the other for\\nthe Achaeans. He took the balance by the middle, and when he lifted it\\nup the day of the Achaeans sank; the death-fraught scale of the\\nAchaeans settled down upon the ground, while that of the Trojans rose\\nheavenwards. Then he thundered aloud from Ida, and sent the glare of\\nhis lightning upon the Achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear fell\\nupon them and they were sore afraid.\\n\\nIdomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two Ajaxes,\\nservants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of Gerene alone\\nstood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, but one of\\nhis horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen had hit it\\nwith an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane begins to grow\\naway from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded in his\\nanguish as the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threw others\\ninto confusion. The old man instantly began cutting the traces with his\\nsword, but Hector\\'s fleet horses bore down upon him through the rout\\nwith their bold charioteer, even Hector himself, and the old man would\\nhave perished there and then had not Diomed been quick to mark, and\\nwith a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.\\n\\n\"Ulysses,\" he cried, \"noble son of Laertes where are you flying to,\\nwith your back turned like a coward? See that you are not struck with a\\nspear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defend Nestor\\nfrom this man\\'s furious onset.\"\\n\\nUlysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the\\nAchaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the thick\\nof the fight took his stand before the horses of the son of Neleus.\\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"these young warriors are pressing you hard, your force\\nis spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught, and your\\nhorses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and see what the horses of\\nTros can do--how cleverly they can scud hither and thither over the\\nplain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them from the hero Aeneas.\\nLet our squires attend to your own steeds, but let us drive mine\\nstraight at the Trojans, that Hector may learn how furiously I too can\\nwield my spear.\"\\n\\nNestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the doughty\\nsquires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor\\'s horses,\\nwhile the two both mounted Diomed\\'s chariot. Nestor took the reins in\\nhis hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up with\\nHector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he was charging\\nfull speed towards them. He missed him, but struck his charioteer and\\nsquire Eniopeus son of noble Thebaeus in the breast by the nipple while\\nthe reins were in his hands, so that he died there and then, and the\\nhorses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot. Hector was greatly\\ngrieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let him lie for all his\\nsorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor did his steeds\\nhave to go long without one, for he presently found brave Archeptolemus\\nthe son of Iphitus, and made him get up behind the horses, giving the\\nreins into his hand.\\n\\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have been\\npenned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and men been\\nquick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which fell just\\nin front of Diomed\\'s horses with a flare of burning brimstone. The\\nhorses were frightened and tried to back beneath the car, while the\\nreins dropped from Nestor\\'s hands. Then he was afraid and said to\\nDiomed, \"Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; see you not that\\nthe hand of Jove is against you? To-day he vouchsafes victory to\\nHector; to-morrow, if it so please him, he will again grant it to\\nourselves; no man, however brave, may thwart the purpose of Jove, for\\nhe is far stronger than any.\"\\n\\nDiomed answered, \"All that you have said is true; there is a grief\\nhowever which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will talk among\\nthe Trojans and say, \\'The son of Tydeus fled before me to the ships.\\'\\nThis is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallow me.\"\\n\\n\"Son of Tydeus,\" replied Nestor, \"what mean you? Though Hector say that\\nyou are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe him, nor\\nyet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low.\"\\n\\nSo saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle,\\nand with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained their\\ndarts after them. Hector shouted to him and said, \"Son of Tydeus, the\\nDanaans have done you honour hitherto as regards your place at table,\\nthe meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.\\nHenceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better than a\\nwoman. Be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale our\\nwalls through any flinching upon my part; neither shall you carry off\\nour wives in your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand.\"\\n\\nThe son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his horses\\nround again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thrice did Jove\\nthunder from the heights of Ida in token to the Trojans that he would\\nturn the battle in their favour. Hector then shouted to them and said,\\n\"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of close fighting, be men, my\\nfriends, and fight with might and with main; I see that Jove is minded\\nto vouchsafe victory and great glory to myself, while he will deal\\ndestruction upon the Danaans. Fools, for having thought of building\\nthis weak and worthless wall. It shall not stay my fury; my horses will\\nspring lightly over their trench, and when I am at their ships forget\\nnot to bring me fire that I may burn them, while I slaughter the\\nArgives who will be all dazed and bewildered by the smoke.\"\\n\\nThen he cried to his horses, \"Xanthus and Podargus, and you Aethon and\\ngoodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all the honey-sweet\\ncorn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion has fed you, and\\nfor she has mixed wine and water for you to drink whenever you would,\\nbefore doing so even for me who am her own husband. Haste in pursuit,\\nthat we may take the shield of Nestor, the fame of which ascends to\\nheaven, for it is of solid gold, arm-rods and all, and that we may\\nstrip from the shoulders of Diomed the cuirass which Vulcan made him.\\nCould we take these two things, the Achaeans would set sail in their\\nships this self-same night.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she shook\\nwith rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god of Neptune,\\n\"What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you find no\\ncompassion in your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring you many a\\nwelcome offering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish them well then. If all of\\nus who are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans back and keep\\nJove from helping them, he would have to sit there sulking alone on\\nIda.\"\\n\\nKing Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, \"Juno, rash of tongue,\\nwhat are you talking about? We other gods must not set ourselves\\nagainst Jove, for he is far stronger than we are.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch, from\\nthe ships even to the wall, was filled with horses and warriors, who\\nwere pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now that the hand of Jove\\nwas with him. He would even have set fire to the ships and burned them,\\nhad not Queen Juno put it into the mind of Agamemnon, to bestir himself\\nand to encourage the Achaeans. To this end he went round the ships and\\ntents carrying a great purple cloak, and took his stand by the huge\\nblack hull of Ulysses\\' ship, which was middlemost of all; it was from\\nthis place that his voice would carry farthest, on the one hand towards\\nthe tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other towards those of\\nAchilles--for these two heroes, well assured of their own strength, had\\nvalorously drawn up their ships at the two ends of the line. From this\\nspot then, with a voice that could be heard afar, he shouted to the\\nDanaans, saying, \"Argives, shame on you cowardly creatures, brave in\\nsemblance only; where are now our vaunts that we should prove\\nvictorious--the vaunts we made so vaingloriously in Lemnos, when we ate\\nthe flesh of horned cattle and filled our mixing-bowls to the brim? You\\nvowed that you would each of you stand against a hundred or two hundred\\nmen, and now you prove no match even for one--for Hector, who will be\\nere long setting our ships in a blaze. Father Jove, did you ever so\\nruin a great king and rob him so utterly of his greatness? Yet, when to\\nmy sorrow I was coming hither, I never let my ship pass your altars\\nwithout offering the fat and thigh-bones of heifers upon every one of\\nthem, so eager was I to sack the city of Troy. Vouchsafe me then this\\nprayer--suffer us to escape at any rate with our lives, and let not the\\nAchaeans be so utterly vanquished by the Trojans.\"\\n\\nThus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed him that\\nhis people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle, most\\nunfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in its talons;\\nthe eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which the Achaeans\\nsacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; when, therefore, the people saw\\nthat the bird had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercely upon the\\nTrojans and fought more boldly.\\n\\nThere was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast that he\\nhad driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fight sooner\\nthan the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so he slew an\\narmed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon. He had\\nturned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the back\\nmidway between his shoulders and went right through his chest, and his\\narmour rang rattling round him as he fell forward from his chariot.\\n\\nAfter him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two Ajaxes\\nclothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and his companion in\\narms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus the brave son of\\nEuaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took his place under cover\\nof the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajax lifted his shield\\nTeucer would peer round, and when he had hit any one in the throng, the\\nman would fall dead; then Teucer would hie back to Ajax as a child to\\nits mother, and again duck down under his shield.\\n\\nWhich of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and then\\nOrmenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlike Lycophontes,\\nAmopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. All these in turn did he lay\\nlow upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he saw him making\\nhavoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to him and said,\\n\"Teucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captain among the\\nhost, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans and the glory\\nof your father Telamon, who brought you up and took care of you in his\\nown house when you were a child, bastard though you were. Cover him\\nwith glory though he is far off; I will promise and I will assuredly\\nperform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant me to sack the city of\\nIlius, you shall have the next best meed of honour after my own--a\\ntripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who shall go up\\ninto your bed.\"\\n\\nAnd Teucer answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge me;\\nfrom the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have never\\nceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot and\\nkill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been buried\\nin the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot hit.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was bent\\non hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hit Priam\\'s\\nbrave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair Castianeira,\\nlovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme, and now he bowed his\\nhead as a garden poppy in full bloom when it is weighed down by showers\\nin spring--even thus heavy bowed his head beneath the weight of his\\nhelmet.\\n\\nAgain he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again his\\narrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector\\'s brave\\ncharioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he was\\ndriving furiously into the fight. The horses swerved aside as he fell\\nheadlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him. Hector\\nwas greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but for all his\\nsorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brother Cebriones,\\nwho was hard by, take the reins. Cebriones did as he had said. Hector\\nthereon with a loud cry sprang from his chariot to the ground, and\\nseizing a great stone made straight for Teucer with intent to kill him.\\nTeucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid it upon the\\nbow-string, but Hector struck him with the jagged stone as he was\\ntaking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit him just\\nwhere the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest, a very deadly\\nplace, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his wrist was less, and\\nthe bow dropped from his hand as he fell forward on his knees. Ajax saw\\nthat his brother had fallen, and running towards him bestrode him and\\nsheltered him with his shield. Meanwhile his two trusty squires,\\nMecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor, came up and bore him to the ships\\ngroaning in his great pain.\\n\\nJove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the Achaeans\\nto their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at their head. As a\\nhound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when he gives him\\nchase, and watches warily for his wheeling, even so did Hector follow\\nclose upon the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost as they rushed\\npanic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the set stakes and\\ntrench and many Achaeans had been laid low at the hands of the Trojans,\\nthey halted at their ships, calling upon one another and praying every\\nman instantly as they lifted up their hands to the gods; but Hector\\nwheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes glaring like those of\\nGorgo or murderous Mars.\\n\\nJuno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to Minerva,\\n\"Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take no more\\nthought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever do\\nso? See how they perish and come to a bad end before the onset of but a\\nsingle man. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury, and\\nhas already done great mischief.\"\\n\\nMinerva answered, \"Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his own\\nland, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Jove is mad\\nwith spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets\\nhow often I saved his son when he was worn out by the labours\\nEurystheus had laid on him. He would weep till his cry came up to\\nheaven, and then Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had the\\nsense to foresee all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house of\\nHades, to fetch the hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have come\\nback alive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jove hates\\nme, while he lets Thetis have her way because she kissed his knees and\\ntook hold of his beard, when she was begging him to do honour to\\nAchilles. I shall know what to do next time he begins calling me his\\ngrey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go within the house of\\naegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; we shall then find out whether\\nPriam\\'s son Hector will be glad to meet us in the highways of battle,\\nor whether the Trojans will glut hounds and vultures with the fat of\\ntheir flesh as they be dead by the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nThus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn,\\nobeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizened steeds,\\nwhile Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung her richly vesture,\\nmade with her own hands, on to the threshold of her father, and donned\\nthe shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle. Then she stepped into her\\nflaming chariot, and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and strong\\nwith which she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno\\nlashed her horses, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew open\\nof their own accord--gates over which the Hours preside, in whose hands\\nare heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides them\\nor to close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds.\\n\\nBut father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sent\\nwinged Iris with a message to them. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, turn\\nthem back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come to\\nfighting there will be mischief. This is what I say, and this is what I\\nmean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl them from\\ntheir chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them all ten\\nyears to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them; my\\ngrey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her father\\nmeans. I am less surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say she\\nalways contradicts me.\"\\n\\nWith this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights of Ida\\nto the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at the outer\\ngates of its many valleys and gave them her message. \"What,\" said she,\\n\"are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn forbids going. This is\\nwhat he says, and this is what he means to do, he will lame your horses for\\nyou, he will hurl you from your chariot, and will break it in pieces.\\nIt will take you all ten years to heal the wounds his lightning will\\ninflict upon you, that you may learn, grey-eyed goddess, what\\nquarrelling with your father means. He is less hurt and angry with\\nJuno, for whatever he says she always contradicts him but you, bold\\nhussy, will you really dare to raise your huge spear in defiance of\\nJove?\"\\n\\nWith this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, \"Of a truth, child\\nof aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men\\'s battles further in\\ndefiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will have it, and let\\nJove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans and Danaans according to\\nhis own pleasure.\"\\n\\nShe turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made them fast\\nto their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against the end wall\\nof the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upon their golden\\nthrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they were very angry.\\n\\nPresently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered the\\nassembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his horses\\nfor him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it. Jove\\nthen sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneath him.\\nMinerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither spoke nor\\nasked him questions, but Jove knew what they meant, and said, \"Minerva\\nand Juno, why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killing so many\\nof your dear friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such is the might\\nof my hands that all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you were both\\nof you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its terrible\\ndoings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been--I should\\nhave struck you with lightning, and your chariots would never have\\nbrought you back again to Olympus.\"\\n\\nMinerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and brooded\\nmischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a word, for she\\nwas in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her father; but\\nJuno could not contain herself and said, \"What, dread son of Saturn,\\nare you talking about? We know how great your power is, nevertheless we\\nhave compassion upon the Danaan warriors who are perishing and coming\\nto a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain from\\nactual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to the\\nArgives, that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do so,\\nyou will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of the Argives,\\nfor fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused the son\\nof Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at their ships\\' sterns\\nabout the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this is how it is decreed;\\nfor aught I care, you may go to the lowest depths beneath earth and\\nsea, where Iapetus and Saturn dwell in lone Tartarus with neither ray\\nof light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may go on and on till\\nyou get there, and I shall not care one whit for your displeasure; you\\nare the greatest vixen living.\"\\n\\nJuno made him no answer. The sun\\'s glorious orb now sank into Oceanus\\nand drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the Trojans when\\nlight failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for did darkness fall\\nupon the Achaeans.\\n\\nThen Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a council on\\nthe open space near the river, where there was a spot clear of corpses.\\nThey left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear the speech\\nhe made them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the bronze point\\nof which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the spear-head\\nwas of gold. Spear in hand he spoke. \"Hear me,\" said he, \"Trojans,\\nDardanians, and allies. I deemed but now that I should destroy the\\nships and all the Achaeans with them ere I went back to Ilius, but\\ndarkness came on too soon. It was this alone that saved them and their\\nships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obey the behests of\\nnight, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of their chariots\\nand give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to bring sheep and\\ncattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your horses and\\ngather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires whose\\nflare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may try to fly beyond the\\nsea by night, and they must not embark scatheless and unmolested; many\\na man among them must take a dart with him to nurse at home, hit with\\nspear or arrow as he is leaping on board his ship, that others may fear\\nto bring war and weeping upon the Trojans. Moreover let the heralds\\ntell it about the city that the growing youths and grey-bearded men are\\nto camp upon its heaven-built walls. Let the women each of them light a\\ngreat fire in her house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town be\\nentered by surprise while the host is outside. See to it, brave\\nTrojans, as I have said, and let this suffice for the moment; at\\ndaybreak I will instruct you further. I pray in hope to Jove and to the\\ngods that we may then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for\\n\\'tis the fates that have borne them and their ships hither. This night,\\ntherefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning let us put on our\\narmour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the Achaeans; I shall then\\nknow whether brave Diomed the son of Tydeus will drive me back from the\\nships to the wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and carry off his\\nbloodstained spoils. To-morrow let him show his mettle, abide my spear\\nif he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall be among the first to\\nfall and many another of his comrades round him. Would that I were as\\nsure of being immortal and never growing old, and of being worshipped\\nlike Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this day will bring evil to the\\nArgives.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took their\\nsweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast each by his own\\nchariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from the city, they\\nbrought wine also and corn from their houses and gathered much wood.\\nThey then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals, and the wind\\ncarried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven--but the blessed gods\\npartook not thereof, for they bitterly hated Ilius with Priam and\\nPriam\\'s people. Thus high in hope they sat through the livelong night\\nby the highways of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle. As when\\nthe stars shine clear, and the moon is bright--there is not a breath of\\nair, not a peak nor glade nor jutting headland but it stands out in the\\nineffable radiance that breaks from the serene of heaven; the stars can\\nall of them be told and the heart of the shepherd is glad--even thus\\nshone the watchfires of the Trojans before Ilius midway between the\\nships and the river Xanthus. A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the\\nplain, and in the glow of each there sat fifty men, while the horses,\\nchamping oats and corn beside their chariots, waited till dawn should\\ncome.',\n",
       " 'Book XVI\\n\\nULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were\\nwere getting breakfast ready at daybreak, for they had sent the men out\\nwith the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark but fawned\\nupon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and noticing that the\\ndogs did not bark, said to Eumaeus:\\n\\n\"Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of\\nyour acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning upon him and\\nnot barking.\"\\n\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the door.\\nEumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing wine\\nfell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his head\\nand both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not be\\nmore delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his old age,\\nafter ten years\\' absence in a foreign country and after having gone\\nthrough much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as though he\\nhad come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:\\n\\n\"So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When I\\nheard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you any\\nmore. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good look\\nat you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into\\nthe country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town\\ngenerally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the\\nsuitors are doing.\"\\n\\n\"So be it, old friend,\" answered Telemachus, \"but I am come now because\\nI want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is still at her\\nold home or whether some one else has married her, so that the bed of\\nUlysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs.\"\\n\\n\"She is still at the house,\" replied Eumaeus, \"grieving and breaking her\\nheart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he took Telemachus\\' spear, whereon he crossed the stone\\nthreshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him place\\nas he entered, but Telemachus checked him; \"Sit down, stranger,\" said\\nhe, \"I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who will lay\\nit for me.\"\\n\\nUlysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green\\nbrushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for Telemachus\\nto sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of cold meat, the\\nremains from what they had eaten the day before, and he filled the bread\\nbaskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine also in bowls of\\nivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they laid their hands\\non the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had\\nenough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus, \"Old friend, where\\ndoes this stranger come from? How did his crew bring him to Ithaca, and\\nwho were they?--for assuredly he did not come here by land.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"My son, I will tell you\\nthe real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great\\ntraveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,\\nand has taken refuge at my station, so I will put him into your hands.\\nDo whatever you like with him, only remember that he is your suppliant.\"\\n\\n\"I am very much distressed,\" said Telemachus, \"by what you have just\\ntold me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young,\\nand am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My mother\\ncannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and look after the\\nhouse out of respect for public opinion and the memory of her husband,\\nor whether the time is now come for her to take the best man of those\\nwho are wooing her, and the one who will make her the most advantageous\\noffer; still, as the stranger has come to your station I will find him\\na cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals, and will send\\nhim wherever he wants to go. Or if you like you can keep him here at the\\nstation, and I will send him clothes and food that he may be no burden\\non you and on your men; but I will not have him go near the suitors,\\nfor they are very insolent, and are sure to ill treat him in a way that\\nwould greatly grieve me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do\\nnothing against numbers, for they will be too strong for him.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses said, \"Sir, it is right that I should say something myself.\\nI am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent way in\\nwhich the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you are. Tell\\nme, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some god set your\\npeople against you? May you not complain of your brothers--for it is to\\nthese that a man may look for support, however great his quarrel may be?\\nI wish I were as young as you are and in my present mind; if I were son\\nto Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would rather some one came\\nand cut my head off, but I would go to the house and be the bane of\\nevery one of these men. {139} If they were too many for me--I being\\nsingle-handed--I would rather die fighting in my own house than see such\\ndisgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men\\ndragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way, wine\\ndrawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that\\nshall never be accomplished.\"\\n\\nAnd Telemachus answered, \"I will tell you truly everything. There is no\\nenmity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, to whom\\na man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove has\\nmade us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius, and\\nUlysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son of Ulysses who\\nleft me behind him when he went away, so that I have never been of any\\nuse to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of numberless\\nmarauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands, Dulichium,\\nSame, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are\\neating up my house under the pretext of paying court to my mother, who\\nwill neither say point blank that she will not marry, nor yet bring\\nmatters to an end, so they are making havoc of my estate, and before\\nlong will do so with myself into the bargain. The issue, however,\\nrests with heaven. But do you, old friend Eumaeus, go at once and tell\\nPenelope that I am safe and have returned from Pylos. Tell it to herself\\nalone, and then come back here without letting any one else know, for\\nthere are many who are plotting mischief against me.\"\\n\\n\"I understand and heed you,\" replied Eumaeus; \"you need instruct me no\\nfurther, only as I am going that way say whether I had not better let\\npoor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend the work\\non his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses, and he would\\neat and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell me that\\nfrom the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten nor\\ndrunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after his farm, but sits\\nweeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.\"\\n\\n\"More\\'s the pity,\" answered Telemachus, \"I am sorry for him, but we must\\nleave him to himself just now. If people could have everything their own\\nway, the first thing I should choose would be the return of my father;\\nbut go, and give your message; then make haste back again, and do not\\nturn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother to send one of her\\nwomen secretly with the news at once, and let him hear it from her.\"\\n\\nThus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals,\\nbound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched\\nhim well off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a\\nwoman--fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the entry,\\nand revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see her, and\\nknew not that she was there, for the gods do not let themselves be seen\\nby everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs, for they did not\\nbark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of the yards.\\nShe nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with her eyebrows; whereon\\nhe left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the yards.\\nThen she said to him:\\n\\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell your\\nson: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for the\\ndestruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will not be\\nlong in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw\\na fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him\\nyounger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,\\nfilled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she\\nwent away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded\\nwhen he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking\\nupon a god.\\n\\n\"Stranger,\" said he, \"how suddenly you have changed from what you were\\na moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your colour is not\\nthe same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If\\nso, be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings\\nof wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses said, \"I am no god, why should you take me for one? I am\\nyour father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the hands\\nof lawless men.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on to the\\nground, for he had restrained all tears till now. But Telemachus could\\nnot yet believe that it was his father, and said:\\n\\n\"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes\\nthat I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself\\ncontrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young\\nat a moment\\'s notice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you\\nwere old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down from\\nheaven.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably\\nastonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who will\\ncome hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and much\\nhardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country. What you\\nwonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, who does with\\nme whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. At one moment she\\nmakes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man with good clothes\\non my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in heaven to make\\nany man look either rich or poor.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father\\nand wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like eagles\\nor vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their half\\nfledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the sun\\nwould have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had not suddenly\\nsaid, \"In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you to Ithaca?\\nOf what nation did they declare themselves to be--for you cannot have\\ncome by land?\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" replied Ulysses. \"It was the\\nPhaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the\\nhabit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took\\nme over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca, after\\ngiving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These things by\\nheaven\\'s mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now come here on\\nthe suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about killing our enemies.\\nFirst, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with their number, that\\nI may learn who, and how many, they are. I can then turn the matter\\nover in my mind, and see whether we two can fight the whole body of them\\nourselves, or whether we must find others to help us.\"\\n\\nTo this Telemachus answered, \"Father, I have always heard of your renown\\nboth in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a very\\ngreat one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot stand\\nagainst many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor twice\\nten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at once.\\nThere are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium, and they have six\\nservants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young Achaeans from\\nZacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well born. They\\nhave with them a servant Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve at\\ntable. If we face such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to rue\\nyour coming, and your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some one\\nwho would be willing to come and help us.\"\\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" replied Ulysses, \"and think whether Minerva and her\\nfather Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find some\\none else as well.\"\\n\\n\"Those whom you have named,\" answered Telemachus, \"are a couple of good\\nallies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have power\\nover both gods and men.\"\\n\\n\"These two,\" continued Ulysses, \"will not keep long out of the fray,\\nwhen the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return\\nhome early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as\\nbefore. Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a\\nmiserable old beggar. If you see them ill treating me, steel your heart\\nagainst my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of\\nthe house, or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently\\ntrying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to\\nyou, for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and\\nlay my saying to your heart; when Minerva shall put it in my mind, I\\nwill nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all\\nthe armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room.\\nMake some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say\\nthat you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it\\nis no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled\\nand begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you are\\nafraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that they\\nmay do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and wooing,\\nfor the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them. But leave\\na sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a couple of oxhide\\nshields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and Minerva\\nwill then soon quiet these people. There is also another matter; if you\\nare indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that\\nUlysses is within the house--neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor\\nany of the servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let you and me exploit\\nthe women alone, and let us also make trial of some other of the men\\nservants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is against us.\"\\n\\n\"Father,\" replied Telemachus, \"you will come to know me by and by, and\\nwhen you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not think,\\nhowever, the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us. Think\\nit over. It will take us a long time to go the round of the farms and\\nexploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be wasting your\\nestate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the women by all\\nmeans, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but I am not in favour\\nof going round and trying the men. We can attend to that later on, if\\nyou really have some sign from Jove that he will support you.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought\\nTelemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When\\nthey had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land;\\ntheir servants came and took their armour from them, and they left all\\nthe presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant to tell\\nPenelope that Telemachus had gone into the country, but had sent the\\nship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.\\nThis servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the\\nsame errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House, the\\nservant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the waiting\\nwomen, \"Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos\"; but Eumaeus went\\nclose up to Penelope, and said privately all that her son had bidden\\nhim tell her. When he had given his message he left the house with its\\noutbuildings and went back to his pigs again.\\n\\nThe suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they\\nwent outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held\\na council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the\\nfirst to speak.\\n\\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"this voyage of Telemachus\\'s is a very serious\\nmatter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however,\\nlet us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send after\\nthe others and tell them to come back as fast as they can.\"\\n\\nHe had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and\\nsaw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails, and\\nputting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others, \"We need\\nnot send them any message, for they are here. Some god must have told\\nthem, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake her.\"\\n\\nOn this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the\\nship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they went\\nup in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let any one\\nold or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke\\nfirst.\\n\\n\"Good heavens,\" said he, \"see how the gods have saved this man from\\ndestruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all day\\nlong, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep, but\\nwaited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and\\nkilling him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let\\nus consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our\\naffair is never likely to come off while he is alive, for he is very\\nshrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on our side. We must make\\nhaste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he will lose no time\\nin doing so, for he will be furious with us, and will tell all the world\\nhow we plotted to kill him, but failed to take him. The people will not\\nlike this when they come to know of it; we must see that they do us no\\nhurt, nor drive us from our own country into exile. Let us try and\\nlay hold of him either on his farm away from the town, or on the road\\nhither. Then we can divide up his property amongst us, and let his\\nmother and the man who marries her have the house. If this does not\\nplease you, and you wish Telemachus to live on and hold his father\\'s\\nproperty, then we must not gather here and eat up his goods in this way,\\nbut must make our offers to Penelope each from his own house, and she\\ncan marry the man who will give the most for her, and whose lot it is to\\nwin her.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the son\\nof Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among all the\\nsuitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of Dulichium; his\\nconversation, moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that of any\\nof the other suitors, for he was a man of good natural disposition. \"My\\nfriends,\" said he, speaking to them plainly and in all honestly, \"I am\\nnot in favour of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous thing to kill one\\nwho is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of the gods, and if the\\noracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to kill him myself, and will\\nurge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade us, I would have you\\nhold your hands.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose\\nforthwith and went to the house of Ulysses, where they took their\\naccustomed seats.\\n\\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. She\\nknew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had overheard\\ntheir counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to the court\\nattended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she stood by\\none of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister holding a\\nveil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:\\n\\n\"Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best\\nspeaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are\\nnothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the death\\nof Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness is Jove\\nhimself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one another.\\nDo you not remember how your father fled to this house in fear of the\\npeople, who were enraged against him for having gone with some Taphian\\npirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us? They\\nwanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses\\nstayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour his\\nproperty without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his wife\\nand trying to kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the others\\nalso.\"\\n\\nTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, \"Take heart, Queen Penelope\\ndaughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters.\\nThe man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon\\nyour son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the\\nearth. I say--and it shall surely be--that my spear shall be reddened\\nwith his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees,\\nheld wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands.\\nTherefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing\\nto fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to him\\nfrom the gods, he cannot escape it.\" He said this to quiet her, but in\\nreality he was plotting against Telemachus.\\n\\nThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva\\nshed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses\\nand his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were\\nhelping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to\\nUlysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke of her wand, and\\nclad him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd might\\nrecognise him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope.\\n\\nTelemachus was the first to speak. \"So you have got back, Eumaeus,\" said\\nhe. \"What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned, or are\\nthey still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?\"\\n\\n\"I did not think of asking about that,\" replied Eumaeus, \"when I was in\\nthe town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon as I\\ncould. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos, and he\\nwas the first to tell the news to your mother, but I can say what I saw\\nwith my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the hill of Mercury\\nabove the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour with a number of\\nmen in her. They had many shields and spears, and I thought it was the\\nsuitors, but I cannot be sure.\"\\n\\nOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus\\ncould not see him.\\n\\nThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they ate\\nit, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As\\nsoon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest and\\nenjoyed the boon of sleep.',\n",
       " 'Book III\\n\\nTELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.\\n\\nbut as the sun was rising from the fair sea {24} into the firmament of\\nheaven to shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos the\\ncity of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore\\nto offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.\\nThere were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were\\nnine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats {25}\\nand burning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune,\\nTelemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship\\nto anchor, and went ashore.\\n\\nMinerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,\\n\"Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have taken\\nthis voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and how he\\ncame by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see what he has\\ngot to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell no lies,\\nfor he is an excellent person.\"\\n\\n\"But how, Mentor,\" replied Telemachus, \"dare I go up to Nestor, and\\nhow am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding long\\nconversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning one who\\nis so much older than myself.\"\\n\\n\"Some things, Telemachus,\" answered Minerva, \"will be suggested to\\nyou by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for I am\\nassured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth\\nuntil now.\"\\n\\nShe then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till they\\nreached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were assembled.\\nThere they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his company round\\nhim were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces of meat on to the\\nspits {26} while other pieces were cooking. When they saw the strangers\\nthey crowded round them, took them by the hand and bade them take their\\nplaces. Nestor\\'s son Pisistratus at once offered his hand to each of\\nthem, and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were lying on the\\nsands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he gave them\\ntheir portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them into a\\ngolden cup, handing it to Minerva first, and saluting her at the same\\ntime.\\n\\n\"Offer a prayer, sir,\" said he, \"to King Neptune, for it is his feast\\nthat you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink\\noffering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt\\nnot that he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without\\nGod in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an\\nage with myself, so I will give you the precedence.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and\\nproper of him to have given it to herself first; {27} she accordingly\\nbegan praying heartily to Neptune. \"O thou,\" she cried, \"that encirclest\\nthe earth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call upon\\nthee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor and\\non his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people some\\nhandsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you. Lastly,\\ngrant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the matter that\\nhas brought us in our ship to Pylos.\"\\n\\nWhen she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to\\nTelemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were\\nroasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man his\\nportion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had had\\nenough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said he, \"that our guests have done their dinner, it will be best\\nto ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you, and from\\nwhat port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail the seas as\\nrovers with your hand against every man, and every man\\'s hand against\\nyou?\"\\n\\nTelemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask\\nabout his father and get himself a good name.\\n\\n\"Nestor,\" said he, \"son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you ask\\nwhence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under Neritum,\\n{28} and the matter about which I would speak is of private not public\\nimport. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said to have\\nsacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what fate\\nbefell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy, but as regards\\nUlysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is dead\\nat all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished, nor say\\nwhether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at sea amid the\\nwaves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your knees, if haply\\nyou may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end, whether you saw it\\nwith your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller, for he was\\na man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for me,\\nbut tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave father\\nUlysses ever did you loyal service, either by word or deed, when you\\nAchaeans were harassed among the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my\\nfavour and tell me truly all.\"\\n\\n\"My friend,\" answered Nestor, \"you recall a time of much sorrow to\\nmy mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while\\nprivateering under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city\\nof king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there--Ajax, Achilles,\\nPatroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a man\\nsingularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much more\\nthan this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story? Though\\nyou were to stay here and question me for five years, or even six, I\\ncould not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would turn\\nhomeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did we try\\nevery kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us; during\\nall this time there was no one who could compare with your father in\\nsubtlety--if indeed you are his son--I can hardly believe my eyes--and\\nyou talk just like him too--no one would say that people of such\\ndifferent ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had any kind\\nof difference from first to last neither in camp nor council, but in\\nsingleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how all might be\\nordered for the best.\\n\\n\"When, however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail\\nin our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex the\\nArgives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been either\\nwise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the\\ndispleasure of Jove\\'s daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel\\nbetween the two sons of Atreus.\\n\\n\"The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for\\nit was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they explained\\nwhy they had called the people together, it seemed that Menelaus was\\nfor sailing homeward at once, and this displeased Agamemnon, who thought\\nthat we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease the anger\\nof Minerva. Fool that he was, he might have known that he would not\\nprevail with her, for when the gods have made up their minds they do not\\nchange them lightly. So the two stood bandying hard words, whereon the\\nAchaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the air, and were of\\ntwo minds as to what they should do.\\n\\n\"That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching\\nmischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into\\nthe water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,\\nabout half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We--the other\\nhalf--embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had\\nsmoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the\\ngods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however, did not yet\\nmean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the course of\\nwhich some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away under\\nUlysses to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I, and all the ships\\nthat were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was brewing.\\nThe son of Tydeus went on also with me, and his crews with him. Later on\\nMenelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found us making up our minds about our\\ncourse--for we did not know whether to go outside Chios by the island\\nof Psyra, keeping this to our left, or inside Chios, over against the\\nstormy headland of Mimas. So we asked heaven for a sign, and were shown\\none to the effect that we should be soonest out of danger if we headed\\nour ships across the open sea to Euboea. This we therefore did, and a\\nfair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage during the night to\\nGeraestus, {29} where we offered many sacrifices to Neptune for\\nhaving helped us so far on our way. Four days later Diomed and his men\\nstationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind\\nnever fell light from the day when heaven first made it fair for me.\\n\\n\"Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything\\nabout the others. I know neither who got home safely nor who were lost\\nbut, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports that\\nhave reached me since I have been here in my own house. They say the\\nMyrmidons returned home safely under Achilles\\' son Neoptolemus; so also\\ndid the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again, lost no men\\nat sea, and all his followers who escaped death in the field got safe\\nhome with him to Crete. No matter how far out of the world you live, you\\nwill have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of\\nAegisthus--and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently pay. See what\\na good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as Orestes\\ndid, who killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble father. You\\ntoo, then--for you are a tall smart-looking fellow--show your mettle and\\nmake yourself a name in story.\"\\n\\n\"Nestor son of Neleus,\" answered Telemachus, \"honour to the Achaean\\nname, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through all\\ntime for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant\\nme to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors, who\\nare ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no such\\nhappiness in store for me and for my father, so we must bear it as best\\nwe may.\"\\n\\n\"My friend,\" said Nestor, \"now that you remind me, I remember to have\\nheard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed towards\\nyou and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely,\\nor are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows but\\nwhat Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in full,\\neither single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If Minerva\\nwere to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses when we were\\nfighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so openly fond of any\\none as Minerva then was of your father), if she would take as good care\\nof you as she did of him, these wooers would soon some of them forget\\ntheir wooing.\"\\n\\nTelemachus answered, \"I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far\\ntoo much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even though the\\ngods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me.\"\\n\\nOn this Minerva said, \"Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven\\nhas a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me, I\\nshould not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I\\ncould be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get home\\nquickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the\\ntreachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain, and when\\na man\\'s hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no matter how fond\\nthey are of him.\"\\n\\n\"Mentor,\" answered Telemachus, \"do not let us talk about it any more.\\nThere is no chance of my father\\'s ever coming back; the gods have long\\nsince counselled his destruction. There is something else, however,\\nabout which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much more than any\\none else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so that it\\nis like talking to an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and tell\\nme true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way? What was Menelaus\\ndoing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better a man than\\nhimself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging elsewhither\\namong mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you truly,\" answered Nestor, \"and indeed you have yourself\\ndivined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy\\nhad found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been no\\nbarrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would have\\nbeen thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and not a woman would\\nhave mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but we\\nwere over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus, who was taking\\nhis ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon\\'s wife\\nClytemnestra with incessant flattery.\\n\\n\"At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she\\nwas of a good natural disposition; {30} moreover there was a bard with\\nher, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy,\\nthat he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled\\nher destruction, Aegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and\\nleft him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon--after which she\\nwent willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he offered many\\nburnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many temples with tapestries\\nand gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations.\\n\\n\"Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms\\nwith one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens,\\nApollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of\\nMenelaus\\' ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in\\nrough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in his hand,\\nand Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had to wait in order\\nto bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites. Presently, when\\nhe too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far as the Malean\\nheads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow hard till the\\nwaves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and took the one\\nhalf towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of\\nthe river Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out\\ninto the sea from a place called Gortyn, and all along this part of the\\ncoast as far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind\\nblowing, but after Phaestus the coast is more protected, for a small\\nheadland can make a great shelter. Here this part of the fleet was\\ndriven on to the rocks and wrecked; but the crews just managed to save\\nthemselves. As for the other five ships, they were taken by winds and\\nseas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and substance among\\npeople of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his\\nevil deed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in\\nMycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year\\nOrestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer\\nof his father. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and\\nof false Aegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very\\nday Menelaus came home, {31} with as much treasure as his ships could\\ncarry.\\n\\n\"Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far\\nfrom home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your\\nhouse; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will\\nhave been on a fool\\'s errand. Still, I should advise you by all means\\nto go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among such\\ndistant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from, when the\\nwinds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds\\ncannot fly the distance in a twelve-month, so vast and terrible are the\\nseas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your\\nown men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have a\\nchariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to\\nLacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he\\nwill tell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said, \"Sir,\\nall that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues of the\\nvictims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to\\nNeptune, and the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed\\ntime. People should go away early and not keep late hours at a religious\\nfestival.\"\\n\\nThus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men\\nservants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled\\nthe mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving\\nevery man his drink offering; then they threw the tongues of the victims\\ninto the fire, and stood up to make their drink offerings. When they\\nhad made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded,\\nMinerva and Telemachus were for going on board their ship, but Nestor\\ncaught them up at once and stayed them.\\n\\n\"Heaven and the immortal gods,\" he exclaimed, \"forbid that you should\\nleave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor and\\nshort of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to\\nfind comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me tell you\\nI have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit the son of\\nmy old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship--not while I\\nlive--nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep open house as I\\nhave done.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva answered, \"Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much\\nbetter that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore, shall\\nreturn with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give\\norders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only older\\nperson among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus\\' own age,\\nwho have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return to the\\nship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to the Cauconians\\nwhere I have a large sum of money long owing to me. As for Telemachus,\\nnow that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let\\none of your sons go with him. Be pleased to also provide him with your\\nbest and fleetest horses.\"\\n\\nWhen she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and all\\nmarvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemachus\\nby the hand. \"My friend,\" said he, \"I see that you are going to be a\\ngreat hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are\\nstill so young. This can have been none other of those who dwell in\\nheaven than Jove\\'s redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who shewed\\nsuch favour towards your brave father among the Argives. Holy queen,\" he\\ncontinued, \"vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself, my good wife,\\nand my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed\\nheifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the\\nyoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.\"\\n\\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to\\nhis own house, followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got\\nthere and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed them\\na bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the housekeeper took\\nthe lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the wine, he prayed much\\nand made drink offerings to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove.\\nThen, when they had made their drink offerings and had drunk each as\\nmuch as he was minded, the others went home to bed each in his own\\nabode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room that was over the\\ngateway along with Pisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now left\\nhim. As for himself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the\\nqueen his wife by his side.\\n\\nNow when the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Nestor left\\nhis couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble\\nthat stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of\\ngods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone to the house of\\nHades; so Nestor sat in his seat sceptre in hand, as guardian of the\\npublic weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him,\\nEchephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son\\nwas Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him sit with\\nthem. Nestor then addressed them.\\n\\n\"My sons,\" said he, \"make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first\\nand foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested\\nherself visibly to me during yesterday\\'s festivities. Go, then, one or\\nother of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer,\\nand come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemachus\\' ship,\\nand invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the vessel.\\nSome one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to gild the\\nhorns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the\\nmaids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to fetch seats,\\nand logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring me some\\nclear spring water.\"\\n\\nOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was\\nbrought in from the plain, and Telemachus\\'s crew came from the ship; the\\ngoldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his\\ngold, and Minerva herself came to accept the sacrifice. Nestor gave out\\nthe gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess\\nmight have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and Echephron brought\\nher in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the house in a ewer that\\nhad a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand he held a basket of\\nbarley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe, ready to\\nstrike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket. Then Nestor began with\\nwashing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal, and he offered many\\na prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock from the heifer\\'s head upon the\\nfire.\\n\\nWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal {32}\\nThrasymedes dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke\\nthat cut through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the\\ndaughters and daughters in law of Nestor, and his venerable wife\\nEurydice (she was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with delight.\\nThen they lifted the heifer\\'s head from off the ground, and Pisistratus\\ncut her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut\\nher up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them\\nround in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top\\nof them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over\\nthem, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in\\ntheir hands. When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward\\nmeats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the\\nspits and toasted them over the fire.\\n\\nMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor\\'s youngest daughter, washed\\nTelemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she\\nbrought him a fair mantle and shirt, {33} and he looked like a god as\\nhe came from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When\\nthe outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to\\ndinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept\\npouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had\\nenough to eat and drink Nestor said, \"Sons, put Telemachus\\'s horses to\\nthe chariot that he may start at once.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the fleet\\nhorses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision\\nof bread, wine, and sweet meats fit for the sons of princes. Then\\nTelemachus got into the chariot, while Pisistratus gathered up the reins\\nand took his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they flew\\nforward nothing loth into the open country, leaving the high citadel of\\nPylos behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon\\ntheir necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the land.\\nThen they reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus\\nand grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diocles\\nentertained them hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered\\nDawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and drove out through the\\ngateway under the echoing gatehouse. {34} Pisistratus lashed the horses\\non and they flew forward nothing loth; presently they came to the corn\\nlands of the open country, and in the course of time completed their\\njourney, so well did their steeds take them. {35}\\n\\nNow when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,',\n",
       " 'BOOK XIX\\n\\n  Achilles is reconciled with Agamemnon, puts on the armour\\n  which Vulcan had made him, and goes out to fight.\\n\\nNOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of\\nOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the\\nships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son\\nfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also of\\nhis followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came among\\nthem she clasped his hand in her own, saying, \"My son, grieve as we may\\nwe must let this man lie, for it is by heaven\\'s will that he has\\nfallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly armour,\\nwhich no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out\\nbravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none\\ndared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to\\nstill greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for he\\nwas glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had made\\nhim. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, he\\nsaid to his mother, \"Mother, the god has given me armour, meet\\nhandiwork for an immortal and such as no-one living could have\\nfashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon\\nthe son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his\\nbody, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\"\\n\\nSilver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, be not disquieted about this\\nmatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome\\nflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle. He\\nmay lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound as\\never, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly;\\nunsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might\\nand main.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she then\\ndropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus, that his\\nbody might suffer no change.\\n\\nThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called on\\nthe Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always at\\nthe ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were\\nabout the ships and served out rations, all came to the place of\\nassembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so\\nlong from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus,\\ncame limping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless they\\ncame, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of\\nall came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of\\nAntenor had struck him with a spear in battle.\\n\\nWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, \"Son of\\nAtreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,\\nwhen we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would have\\nbeen better, had Diana\\'s arrow slain her at the ships on the day when I\\ntook her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an Achaean the\\nless would have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my anger. It\\nhas been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the Achaeans will long\\nindeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let it be, for it is over.\\nIf we have been angry, necessity has schooled our anger. I put it from\\nme: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore, bid the Achaeans arm\\nforthwith that I may go out against the Trojans, and learn whether they\\nwill be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be\\nto rest his knees who may fly my spear when I wield it.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away\\nhis anger.\\n\\nThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the\\nmiddle of the assembly. \"Danaan heroes,\" said he, \"servants of Mars, it\\nis well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not seemly\\nto interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised speaker. Who\\ncan either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest orator will be\\ndisconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus, and do you\\nother Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the Achaeans spoken\\nto me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was not I that did it:\\nJove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in darkness struck me mad when we\\nwere assembled on the day that I took from Achilles the meed that had\\nbeen awarded to him. What could I do? All things are in the hand of\\nheaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove\\'s daughters, shuts men\\'s eyes to\\ntheir destruction. She walks delicately, not on the solid earth, but\\nhovers over the heads of men to make them stumble or to ensnare them.\\n\\n\"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest\\nwhether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him on\\nthe day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair\\ncity of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, \\'Hear me, all\\ngods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day\\nshall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child\\ninto the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him who are\\nof my blood and lineage.\\' Then said Juno all crafty and full of guile,\\n\\'You will play false, and will not hold to your word. Swear me, O\\nOlympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day fall\\nbetween the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell about\\nhim who are of your blood and lineage.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath,\\nto his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high summit\\nof Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that the\\nnoble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with child\\nand in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth though there\\nwas a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena, and\\nkept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of Saturn,\\nand said, \\'Father Jove, lord of the lightning--I have a word for your\\near. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus\\nthe son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well, therefore, that\\nhe should reign over the Argives.\\'\\n\\n\"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught\\nFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she again\\ninvade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then he\\nwhirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down from\\nheaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he was ever\\nangry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel labours\\nthat Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty Hector\\nwas killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time I kept\\nthinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove robbed me\\nof my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much treasure by\\nway of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your people with\\nyou. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you yesterday in your\\ntents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain fight at\\nonce, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship, that you may\\nsee whether what I give you is enough.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you can\\ngive such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them: it is in\\nyour own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not well to tarry\\ntalking about trifles, for there is a deed which is as yet to do.\\nAchilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost, and laying\\nlow the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of you when he\\nis fighting.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses said, \"Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans\\nthus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will be\\nno brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sides\\nwith fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships,\\nfor in this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle the\\nlivelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food;\\nhowever much he may want to fight his strength will fail him before he\\nknows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will grow\\nweary under him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed with\\nmeat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he\\nhas routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them\\nprepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts in presence\\nof the assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied.\\nMoreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that he has never\\ngone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her after the manner\\nof men and women; and do you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind;\\nlet Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with a feast of\\nreconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full. As for you,\\nson of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future; it is no\\ndisgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong in\\nthe first instance.\"\\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Son of Laertes, your words please me\\nwell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would\\nhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name\\nof heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fain fight\\nat once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from my tent\\nand we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge you:\\ntake some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from my tents the\\ngifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the women also;\\nfurthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those that are with the\\nhost, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and to the sun.\"\\n\\nThen said Achilles, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to these\\nmatters at some other season, when there is breathing time and when I\\nam calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those whom Hector\\nson of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain? Let the sons\\nof the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and without food, till we have\\navenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun let them eat\\ntheir fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying dead in my tent, all hacked\\nand hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades are mourning\\nround him. Therefore I can take thought of nothing save only slaughter\\nand blood and the rattle in the throat of the dying.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the\\nAchaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than a little,\\nbut in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater\\nknowledge. Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of\\nwhich men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is war\\'s steward, weighs the\\nupshot, it may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped\\nis far heavier than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should\\nmourn the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick and\\nthreefold continually; when should we have respite from our sorrow? Let\\nus mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but\\nlet those of us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight\\nour foes more fiercely. In that hour let no man hold back, waiting for\\na second summons; such summons shall bode ill for him who is found\\nlagging behind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and loose\\nthe fury of war upon the Trojans.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with Meges\\nson of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes, and\\nMelanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The word\\nwas not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out the seven\\ntripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty metal cauldrons\\nand the twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled in useful\\narts, seven in number, with Briseis, which made eight. Ulysses weighed\\nout the ten talents of gold and then led the way back, while the young\\nAchaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid them in the middle of\\nthe assembly.\\n\\nAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a god\\ncame to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife which he\\nwore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting off some\\nbristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as he did so.\\nThe other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly to hear\\nthe king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and prayed\\nsaying, \"I call Jove the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, I\\ncall also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who dwell below and take\\nvengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that I have laid no hand upon\\nthe girl Briseis, neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise, but that\\nshe has remained in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely may heaven\\nvisit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those who perjure\\nthemselves.\"\\n\\nHe cut the boar\\'s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled it\\nround his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes. Then\\nAchilles also rose and said to the Argives, \"Father Jove, of a truth\\nyou blind men\\'s eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had not else\\nstirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken Briseis from\\nme against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled the destruction of\\nmany an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that we may begin fighting.\"\\n\\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\\nship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to the\\nship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the stable-men\\ndrove the horses in among the others.\\n\\nBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of Patroclus,\\nflung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her breast, her neck,\\nand her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful as a goddess she\\nwept and said, \"Patroclus, dearest friend, when I went hence I left you\\nliving; I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows\\nmultiply upon me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father and\\nmother married me, cut down before our city, and my three own dear\\nbrothers perished with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus,\\neven when Achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes,\\ntold me that I was not to weep, for you said you would make Achilles\\nmarry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, we should have a wedding\\nfeast among the Myrmidons. You were always kind to me and I shall never\\ncease to grieve for you.\"\\n\\nShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making as\\nthough their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was weeping\\nfor her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round Achilles\\nand prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. \"I\\npray you,\" said he, \"if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat\\nnor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even to\\nthe going down of the sun.\"\\n\\nOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of\\nAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who\\nstayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow:\\nbut he would not be comforted till he should have flung himself into\\nthe jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of\\nPatroclus. Then he said--\\n\\n\"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner\\nready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were hasting\\nto fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and drink in\\nmy tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this I could\\nnot know, not even though I were to hear of the death of my father, who\\nis now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who am here\\nfighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake of Helen,\\nnor yet though I should hear that my son is no more--he who is being\\nbrought up in Scyros--if indeed Neoptolemus is still living. Till now I\\nmade sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy away from Argos, while\\nyou were to return to Phthia, bring back my son with you in your own\\nship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen, and the greatness of\\nmy house--for Peleus must surely be either dead, or what little life\\nremains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities of age and ever\\npresent fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of my death.\"\\n\\nHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought\\non what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn looked down\\nwith pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, \"My child, you have\\nquite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of your\\nrecollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss of\\nhis dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner he\\nwill neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar and ambrosia into\\nhis breast, that he may know no hunger.\"\\n\\nWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.\\nShe darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing on\\nhis broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming\\nthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosia\\ninto Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail\\nhim, she went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the\\nchill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne on the keen\\nblasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming helmets, the\\nbossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the ashen spears\\nstream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the whole land was\\nradiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of the tramp of their\\ntreading rose from under their feet. In the midst of them all Achilles\\nput on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire,\\nfor his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus, then, full of fury\\nagainst the Trojans, did he don the gift of the god, the armour that\\nVulcan had made him.\\n\\nFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and next\\nhe did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the silver-studded\\nsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield so\\ngreat and strong that shone afar with a splendour as of the moon. As\\nthe light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a fire in\\ntheir homestead high up among the mountains, but the sailors are\\ncarried out to sea by wind and storm far from the haven where they\\nwould be--even so did the gleam of Achilles\\' wondrous shield strike up\\ninto the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon his\\nhead, from whence it shone like a star, and the golden plumes which\\nVulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved all around\\nit. Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armour to see whether it\\nfitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and it seemed\\nto buoy him up as though it had been wings.\\n\\nHe also drew his father\\'s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so\\ngreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles\\nhad strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash from the\\ntopmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus,\\nfraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied\\nthemselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast\\nabout them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the reins back\\ntowards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind the\\nhorses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armour, resplendent as\\nthe sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he chided with his\\nfather\\'s horses saying, \"Xanthus and Balius, famed offspring of\\nPodarge--this time when we have done fighting be sure and bring your\\ndriver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him\\ndead on the plain as you did Patroclus.\"\\n\\nThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke--for white-armed Juno had\\nendowed him with human speech--and he bowed his head till his mane\\ntouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. \"Dread\\nAchilles,\" said he, \"we will indeed save you now, but the day of your\\ndeath is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be heaven\\nand stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth\\nor slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus of his\\narmour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him as he\\nfought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector. We two\\ncan fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetest of all winds;\\nnevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a man and of a god.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles\\nanswered him in great sadness, saying, \"Why, O Xanthus, do you thus\\nforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to\\nfall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,\\nshall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of\\nfighting.\"\\n\\nSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XIV\\n\\n  Agamemnon proposes that the Achaeans should sail home, and\\n  is rebuked by Ulysses--Juno beguiles Jupiter--Hector is\\n  wounded.\\n\\nNESTOR was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not escape\\nhim, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, \"What, noble Machaon, is\\nthe meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by our ships grow\\nstronger and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit over your wine,\\nwhile fair Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clotted blood from\\noff you. I will go at once to the look-out station and see what it is\\nall about.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was lying\\nin his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had taken his\\nfather\\'s shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and as\\nsoon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans who, now\\nthat their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before the\\nTrojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the waves are\\ndumb--they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter whence the\\nfierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where they are and set\\nneither this way nor that, till some particular wind sweeps down from\\nheaven to determine them--even so did the old man ponder whether to\\nmake for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search of Agamemnon. In the end\\nhe deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus; but meanwhile the hosts\\nwere fighting and killing one another, and the hard bronze rattled on\\ntheir bodies, as they thrust at one another with their swords and\\nspears.\\n\\nThe wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son of\\nAtreus, fell in with Nestor as they were coming up from their\\nships--for theirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was\\ngoing on, being on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached\\nfirst, while the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch\\nof the shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all the\\nships, and the host was cramped for space, therefore they had placed\\nthe ships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the whole\\nopening of the bay between the two points that formed it. The kings,\\nleaning on their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being in\\ngreat anxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled with\\ndismay. Then King Agamemnon said to him, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour\\nto the Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? I\\nfear that what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted among\\nthe Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had fired\\nour ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is all coming\\ntrue. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles, are in such anger with\\nme that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships.\"\\n\\nThen Nestor knight of Gerene, answered, \"It is indeed as you say; it is\\nall coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thunders from on high\\ncannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we relied as an\\nimpregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. The Trojans are fighting\\nstubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look where you may you\\ncannot see from what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming; they\\nare being killed in a confused mass and the battle-cry ascends to\\nheaven; let us think, if counsel can be of any use, what we had better\\ndo; but I do not advise our going into battle ourselves, for a man\\ncannot fight when he is wounded.\"\\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed\\nfighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench\\nhas served us--over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they\\ndeemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet--I see\\nit must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish\\ningloriously here, far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing to\\ndefend us, and I know now that he is raising the Trojans to like honour\\nwith the gods, while us, on the other hand, he has bound hand and foot.\\nNow, therefore, let us all do as I say; let us bring down the ships\\nthat are on the beach and draw them into the water; let us make them\\nfast to their mooring-stones a little way out, against the fall of\\nnight--if even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting; we may\\nthen draw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong in flying\\nruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should fly and be\\nsaved than be caught and killed.\"\\n\\nUlysses looked fiercely at him and said, \"Son of Atreus, what are you\\ntalking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other and baser\\narmy, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted a life of\\nhard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of us perish. Is\\nit thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win which we have\\nsuffered so much hardship? Hold your peace, lest some other of the\\nAchaeans hear you say what no man who knows how to give good counsel,\\nno king over so great a host as that of the Argives should ever have\\nlet fall from his lips. I despise your judgement utterly for what you\\nhave been saying. Would you, then, have us draw down our ships into the\\nwater while the battle is raging, and thus play further into the hands\\nof the conquering Trojans? It would be ruin; the Achaeans will not go\\non fighting when they see the ships being drawn into the water, but\\nwill cease attacking and keep turning their eyes towards them; your\\ncounsel, therefore, sir captain, would be our destruction.\"\\n\\nAgamemnon answered, \"Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart. I\\nam not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships into the sea\\nwhether they will or no. Someone, it may be, old or young, can offer us\\nbetter counsel which I shall rejoice to hear.\"\\n\\nThen said Diomed, \"Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek, if\\nyou will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am younger\\nthan any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who lies\\nburied at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom,\\nAgrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third was the\\nknight Oeneus, my father\\'s father, and he was the most valiant of them\\nall. Oeneus remained in his own country, but my father (as Jove and the\\nother gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He married into the family\\nof Adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance, for he had large\\nestates of rich corn-growing land, with much orchard ground as well,\\nand he had many sheep; moreover he excelled all the Argives in the use\\nof the spear. You must yourselves have heard whether these things are\\ntrue or no; therefore when I say well despise not my words as though I\\nwere a coward or of ignoble birth. I say, then, let us go to the fight\\nas we needs must, wounded though we be. When there, we may keep out of\\nthe battle and beyond the range of the spears lest we get fresh wounds\\nin addition to what we have already, but we can spur on others, who\\nhave been indulging their spleen and holding aloof from battle\\nhitherto.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out,\\nKing Agamemnon leading the way.\\n\\nMeanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them in\\nthe semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon\\'s right hand in his own\\nand said, \"Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that he sees\\nthe Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse--may\\nhe come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself, the\\nblessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the\\nprinces and counsellors of the Trojans shall again raise the dust upon\\nthe plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tents\\ntowards their city.\"\\n\\nWith this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to the\\nplain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nine or\\nten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight, and it\\nput fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage war and do\\nbattle without ceasing.\\n\\nJuno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of\\nOlympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was at once\\nher brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither amid\\nthe fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on the topmost\\ncrests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She set herself to\\nthink how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemed that it\\nwould be best for her to go to Ida and array herself in rich attire, in\\nthe hope that Jove might become enamoured of her, and wish to embrace\\nher. While he was thus engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be made\\nto steal over his eyes and senses.\\n\\nShe went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made her, and\\nthe doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of a secret key\\nso that no other god could open them. Here she entered and closed the\\ndoors behind her. She cleansed all the dirt from her fair body with\\nambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil, ambrosial, very\\nsoft, and scented specially for herself--if it were so much as shaken\\nin the bronze-floored house of Jove, the scent pervaded the universe of\\nheaven and earth. With this she anointed her delicate skin, and then\\nshe plaited the fair ambrosial locks that flowed in a stream of golden\\ntresses from her immortal head. She put on the wondrous robe which\\nMinerva had worked for her with consummate art, and had embroidered\\nwith manifold devices; she fastened it about her bosom with golden\\nclasps, and she girded herself with a girdle that had a hundred\\ntassels: then she fastened her earrings, three brilliant pendants that\\nglistened most beautifully, through the pierced lobes of her ears, and\\nthrew a lovely new veil over her head. She bound her sandals on to her\\nfeet, and when she had arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction,\\nshe left her room and called Venus to come aside and speak to her. \"My\\ndear child,\" said she, \"will you do what I am going to ask of you, or\\nwill you refuse me because you are angry at my being on the Danaan\\nside, while you are on the Trojan?\"\\n\\nJove\\'s daughter Venus answered, \"Juno, august queen of goddesses,\\ndaughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it for you\\nat once, if I can, and if it can be done at all.\"\\n\\nThen Juno told her a lying tale and said, \"I want you to endow me with\\nsome of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring all things\\nmortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world\\'s end to\\nvisit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys: they\\nreceived me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up, having\\ntaken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn in the\\ndepths that are under earth and sea. I must go and see them that I may\\nmake peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and are so angry\\nthat they have not slept with one another this long while; if I can\\nbring them round and restore them to one another\\'s embraces, they will\\nbe grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards.\"\\n\\nThereon laughter-loving Venus said, \"I cannot and must not refuse you,\\nfor you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered girdle\\ninto which all her charms had been wrought--love, desire, and that\\nsweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the most prudent. She\\ngave the girdle to Juno and said, \"Take this girdle wherein all my\\ncharms reside and lay it in your bosom. If you will wear it I promise\\nyou that your errand, be it what it may, will not be bootless.\"\\n\\nWhen she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the girdle\\nin her bosom.\\n\\nVenus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted down from\\nthe summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair Emathia, and\\nwent on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of the Thracian\\nhorsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without ever setting foot\\nto ground. When she came to Athos she went on over the waves of the sea\\ntill she reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas. There she met Sleep,\\nown brother to Death, and caught him by the hand, saying, \"Sleep, you\\nwho lord it alike over mortals and immortals, if you ever did me a\\nservice in times past, do one for me now, and I shall be grateful to\\nyou ever after. Close Jove\\'s keen eyes for me in slumber while I hold\\nhim clasped in my embrace, and I will give you a beautiful golden seat,\\nthat can never fall to pieces; my clubfooted son Vulcan shall make it\\nfor you, and he shall give it a footstool for you to rest your fair\\nfeet upon when you are at table.\"\\n\\nThen Sleep answered, \"Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of\\nmighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep without\\ncompunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all of\\nthem proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleep unless\\nhe bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing what you asked\\nme, on the day when Jove\\'s mighty son Hercules set sail from Ilius\\nafter having sacked the city of the Trojans. At your bidding I suffused\\nmy sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and laid him to\\nrest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and set the blasts\\nof the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took him to the\\ngoodly city of Cos, away from all his friends. Jove was furious when he\\nawoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the house; he was\\nlooking more particularly for myself, and would have flung me down\\nthrough space into the sea where I should never have been heard of any\\nmore, had not Night who cows both men and gods protected me. I fled to\\nher and Jove left off looking for me in spite of his being so angry,\\nfor he did not dare do anything to displease Night. And now you are\\nagain asking me to do something on which I cannot venture.\"\\n\\nAnd Juno said, \"Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into your\\nhead? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans, as he\\nwas about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of the youngest of\\nthe Graces, and she shall be your own--Pasithea, whom you have always\\nwanted to marry.\"\\n\\nSleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, \"Then swear it to\\nme by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on the bounteous\\nearth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that all the gods who\\ndwell down below with Saturn may be our witnesses, and see that you\\nreally do give me one of the youngest of the Graces--Pasithea, whom I\\nhave always wanted to marry.\"\\n\\nJuno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of the\\nnether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she had completed\\nher oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist and sped\\nlightly forward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them. Presently they\\nreached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and Lectum where\\nthey left the sea to go on by land, and the tops of the trees of the\\nforest soughed under the going of their feet. Here Sleep halted, and\\nere Jove caught sight of him he climbed a lofty pine-tree--the tallest\\nthat reared its head towards heaven on all Ida. He hid himself behind\\nthe branches and sat there in the semblance of the sweet-singing bird\\nthat haunts the mountains and is called Chalcis by the gods, but men\\ncall it Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, the topmost peak of Ida,\\nand Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon her. As soon as he did so\\nhe became inflamed with the same passionate desire for her that he had\\nfelt when they had first enjoyed each other\\'s embraces, and slept with\\none another without their dear parents knowing anything about it. He\\nwent up to her and said, \"What do you want that you have come hither\\nfrom Olympus--and that too with neither chariot nor horses to convey\\nyou?\"\\n\\nThen Juno told him a lying tale and said, \"I am going to the world\\'s\\nend, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and mother\\nTethys; they received me into their house, took care of me, and brought\\nme up. I must go and see them that I may make peace between them: they\\nhave been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not slept with\\none another this long time. The horses that will take me over land and\\nsea are stationed on the lowermost spurs of many-fountained Ida, and I\\nhave come here from Olympus on purpose to consult you. I was afraid you\\nmight be angry with me later on, if I went to the house of Oceanus\\nwithout letting you know.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove said, \"Juno, you can choose some other time for paying your\\nvisit to Oceanus--for the present let us devote ourselves to love and\\nto the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been so overpowered\\nby passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am at this moment\\nfor yourself--not even when I was in love with the wife of Ixion who\\nbore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with Danae the\\ndaintily-ancled daughter of Acrisius, who bore me the famed hero\\nPerseus. Then there was the daughter of Phoenix, who bore me Minos and\\nRhadamanthus: there was Semele, and Alcmena in Thebes by whom I begot\\nmy lion-hearted son Hercules, while Semele became mother to Bacchus the\\ncomforter of mankind. There was queen Ceres again, and lovely Leto, and\\nyourself--but with none of these was I ever so much enamoured as I now\\nam with you.\"\\n\\nJuno again answered him with a lying tale. \"Most dread son of Saturn,\"\\nshe exclaimed, \"what are you talking about? Would you have us enjoy one\\nanother here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything can be seen?\\nWhat if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleeping together,\\nand tell the others? It would be such a scandal that when I had risen\\nfrom your embraces I could never show myself inside your house again;\\nbut if you are so minded, there is a room which your son Vulcan has\\nmade me, and he has given it good strong doors; if you would so have\\nit, let us go thither and lie down.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"Juno, you need not be afraid that either god or man\\nwill see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a dense golden\\ncloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams shall not\\nsee through it.\"\\n\\nWith this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace; whereon the\\nearth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with dew-bespangled\\nlotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that it raised them well\\nabove the ground. Here they laid themselves down and overhead they were\\ncovered by a fair cloud of gold, from which there fell glittering\\ndew-drops.\\n\\nThus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the crest\\nof Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his spouse in\\nhis arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the Achaeans, to\\ntell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the earthquake. When he had\\nfound him he said, \"Now, Neptune, you can help the Danaans with a will,\\nand give them victory though it be only for a short time while Jove is\\nstill sleeping. I have sent him into a sweet slumber, and Juno has\\nbeguiled him into going to bed with her.\"\\n\\nSleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind, leaving\\nNeptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He darted forward\\namong the first ranks and shouted saying, \"Argives, shall we let Hector\\nson of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships and covering himself\\nwith glory? This is what he says that he shall now do, seeing that\\nAchilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; we shall get on very well\\nwithout him if we keep each other in heart and stand by one another.\\nNow, therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us each take the best and\\nlargest shield we can lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally forth\\nwith our longest spears in our hands; I will lead you on, and Hector\\nson of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold out against us. If\\nany good staunch soldier has only a small shield, let him hand it over\\nto a worse man, and take a larger one for himself.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of Tydeus,\\nUlysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the others in\\narray, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges of armour; the\\nmost valiant took the best armour, and gave the worse to the worse man.\\nWhen they had donned their bronze armour they marched on with Neptune\\nat their head. In his strong hand he grasped his terrible sword, keen\\nof edge and flashing like lightning; woe to him who comes across it in\\nthe day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away from it.\\n\\nHector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptune and\\nHector waged fierce war on one another--Hector on the Trojan and\\nNeptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forces\\nmet; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and tents of the\\nAchaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly when driven\\nbefore the blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forest fire roar\\nmore fiercely when it is well alight upon the mountains, nor does the\\nwind bellow with ruder music as it tears on through the tops of when it\\nis blowing its hardest, than the terrible shout which the Trojans and\\nAchaeans raised as they sprang upon one another.\\n\\nHector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards him,\\nnor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two bands passed\\nover his chest--the band of his shield and that of his silver-studded\\nsword--and these protected his body. Hector was angry that his spear\\nshould have been hurled in vain, and withdrew under cover of his men.\\nAs he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamon, struck him with a\\nstone, of which there were many lying about under the men\\'s feet as\\nthey fought--brought there to give support to the ships\\' sides as they\\nlay on the shore. Ajax caught up one of them and struck Hector above\\nthe rim of his shield close to his neck; the blow made him spin round\\nlike a top and reel in all directions. As an oak falls headlong when\\nuprooted by the lightning flash of father Jove, and there is a terrible\\nsmell of brimstone--no man can help being dismayed if he is standing\\nnear it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing--even so did Hector\\nfall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell from his hand, but his\\nshield and helmet were made fast about his body, and his bronze armour\\nrang about him.\\n\\nThe sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him,\\nhoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans,\\nbut none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and covered\\nby the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captain of the\\nLycians, and noble Glaucus. Of the others, too, there was not one who\\nwas unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over him to\\ncover him. His comrades then lifted him off the ground and bore him\\naway from the battle to the place where his horses stood waiting for\\nhim at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot; these\\nthen took him towards the city groaning and in great pain. When they\\nreached the ford of the fair stream of Xanthus, begotten of Immortal\\nJove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on the\\nground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathed\\nagain and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomited blood,\\nbut soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were again closed in\\ndarkness for he was still stunned by the blow.\\n\\nWhen the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart and set\\nupon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of Oileus began by\\nspringing on Satnius son of Enops, and wounding him with his spear: a\\nfair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as he was herding cattle by the\\nbanks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus came up to him and\\nstruck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce fight between\\nTrojans and Danaans raged round his body. Polydamas son of Panthous\\ndrew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor son of Areilycus on the\\nright shoulder; the terrible spear went right through his shoulder, and\\nhe clutched the earth as he fell in the dust. Polydamas vaunted loudly\\nover him saying, \"Again I take it that the spear has not sped in vain\\nfrom the strong hand of the son of Panthous; an Argive has caught it in\\nhis body, and it will serve him for a staff as he goes down into the\\nhouse of Hades.\"\\n\\nThe Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon was\\nmore angry than any, for the man had fallen close beside him; so he\\naimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself by\\nswerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, for\\nheaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where the head springs\\nfrom the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severed both the\\ntendons at the back of the head. His head, mouth, and nostrils reached\\nthe ground long before his legs and knees could do so, and Ajax shouted\\nto Polydamas saying, \"Think, Polydamas, and tell me truly whether this\\nman is not as well worth killing as Prothoenor was: he seems rich, and\\nof rich family, a brother, it may be, or son of the knight Antenor, for\\nhe is very like him.\"\\n\\nBut he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered.\\nAcamas then bestrode his brother\\'s body and wounded Promachus the\\nBoeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother\\'s body\\naway. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying, \"Argive archers, braggarts\\nthat you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only, but some of\\nyou too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See how Promachus now\\nsleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother\\'s blood has not\\nbeen long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he leaves\\na kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall.\"\\n\\nHis taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged than\\nany of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not stand his\\nground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-master Phorbas,\\nwhom Mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealth than any\\nother of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleos now\\nwounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball from\\nits socket: the spear went right through the eye into the nape of the\\nneck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him. Peneleos then\\ndrew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and helmet\\ncame tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking in the\\neye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a poppy-head, and\\nshowed it to the Trojans, vaunting over them as he did so. \"Trojans,\"\\nhe cried, \"bid the father and mother of noble Ilioneus make moan for\\nhim in their house, for the wife also of Promachus son of Alegenor will\\nnever be gladdened by the coming of her dear husband--when we Argives\\nreturn with our ships from Troy.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about to\\nsee whither he might fly for safety.\\n\\nTell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of the\\nArgives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord of the\\nearthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was first\\nto wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians.\\nAntilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew Morys and\\nHippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The son of\\nAtreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in the flank, and\\nthe bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among them;\\non this his life came hurrying out of him at the place where he had\\nbeen wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son of Oileus\\nkilled more than any other, for there was no man so fleet as he to\\npursue flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.',\n",
       " 'Book VII\\n\\nRECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.\\n\\nThus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the\\ntown. When she reached her father\\'s house she drew up at the gateway,\\nand her brothers--comely as the gods--gathered round her, took the mules\\nout of the waggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while she\\nwent to her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit\\nthe fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira,\\nand had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over the\\nPhaeacians, and the people obeyed him as though he were a god. {57}\\nShe had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and\\nbrought her supper for her into her own room.\\n\\nPresently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed a\\nthick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud Phaeacians\\nwho met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was. Then, as he\\nwas just entering the town, she came towards him in the likeness of a\\nlittle girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front of him, and\\nUlysses said:\\n\\n\"My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous?\\nI am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in your\\ntown and country.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you\\nwant, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will go before\\nyou and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look\\nat any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide\\nstrangers, and do not like men who come from some other place. They are\\na sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships\\nthat glide along like thought, or as a bird in the air.\"\\n\\nOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one\\nof the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the\\nmidst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards\\nhim had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their\\nharbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city,\\nwhich, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when\\nthey reached the king\\'s house Minerva said:\\n\\n\"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you.\\nYou will find a number of great people sitting at table, but do not be\\nafraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is to\\ncarry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen. Her\\nname is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband Alcinous.\\nThey both descend originally from Neptune, who was father to Nausithous\\nby Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea was the youngest daughter\\nof Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over the giants, but he ruined his\\nill-fated people and lost his own life to boot.\\n\\n\"Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the\\ngreat Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithous had two\\nsons Rhexenor and Alcinous; {58} Apollo killed the first of them while\\nhe was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter\\nArete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as no other woman is honoured\\nof all those that keep house along with their husbands.\\n\\n\"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her\\nchildren, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon\\nher as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for\\nshe is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any\\nwomen are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to settle\\ntheir disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope\\nof seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to your home and\\ncountry.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to\\nMarathon {59} and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered\\nthe abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,\\nand he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold\\nof bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or\\nmoon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the\\ncornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of\\nsilver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver and\\nthe hook of the door was of gold.\\n\\nOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with\\nhis consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the\\npalace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow old.\\nSeats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end to the\\nother, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the house\\nhad made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit and eat\\nand drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there were golden\\nfigures of young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised on\\npedestals, to give light by night to those who were at table. There are\\n{60} fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always grinding\\nrich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom, or sit and\\nspin, and their shuttles go backwards and forwards like the fluttering\\nof aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that it will turn\\noil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so their women\\nexcel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them all manner of\\nuseful arts, and they are very intelligent.\\n\\nOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of\\nabout four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful\\ntrees--pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are\\nluscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor\\nfail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so\\nsoft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on\\npear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for\\nthere is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,\\nthe grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being\\ngathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on\\nhave shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again\\nare just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are\\nbeautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year\\nround. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts throughout the\\nwhole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the outer\\ncourt to the house itself, and the town\\'s people draw water from it.\\nSuch, then, were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the\\nhouse of king Alcinous.\\n\\nSo here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he\\nhad looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the\\nprecincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the\\nPhaeacians making their drink offerings to Mercury, which they always\\ndid the last thing before going away for the night. {61} He went\\nstraight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness\\nin which Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King\\nAlcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at\\nthat moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became\\nvisible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,\\nbut Ulysses began at once with his petition.\\n\\n\"Queen Arete,\" he exclaimed, \"daughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress\\nI humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests (whom may\\nheaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they leave their\\npossessions to their children, and all the honours conferred upon them\\nby the state) to help me home to my own country as soon as possible; for\\nI have been long in trouble and away from my friends.\"\\n\\nThen he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their\\npeace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent\\nspeaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty\\naddressed them thus:\\n\\n\"Alcinous,\" said he, \"it is not creditable to you that a stranger should\\nbe seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is waiting to\\nhear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and take a seat\\non a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix some wine and\\nwater that we may make a drink offering to Jove the lord of thunder,\\nwho takes all well disposed suppliants under his protection; and let\\nthe housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever there may be in the\\nhouse.\"\\n\\nWhen Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from\\nthe hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting\\nbeside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought him\\nwater in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for\\nhim to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper\\nservant brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there\\nwas in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous said to one\\nof the servants, \"Pontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand it round that\\nwe may make drink-offerings to Jove the lord of thunder, who is the\\nprotector of all well-disposed suppliants.\"\\n\\nPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving\\nevery man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and\\nhad drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:\\n\\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You\\nhave had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall\\ninvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial\\nbanquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his\\nescort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing to his\\nown country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no matter how\\ndistant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his\\nhomeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have to take\\nthe luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is\\npossible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who\\nhas come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods\\nare departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made\\nthemselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them\\nhecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,\\nand if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other\\nof them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the\\ngods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.\" {62}\\n\\nThen Ulysses said: \"Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into\\nyour head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body\\nnor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted.\\nIndeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me,\\nyou would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,\\nlet me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very\\nimportunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man\\'s notice no matter how\\ndire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I shall\\neat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only\\non the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose,\\nand at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content\\nto die if I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and all\\nthe greatness of my house.\" {63}\\n\\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he\\nshould have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when\\nthey had made their drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he\\nwas minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving\\nUlysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were\\ntaking the things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak,\\nfor she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses\\nwas wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said,\\n\"Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should like\\nto ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did\\nyou not say you had come here from beyond the sea?\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate\\nin full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid\\nheavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island far away\\nin the sea which is called \\'the Ogygian.\\' Here dwells the cunning and\\npowerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far\\nfrom all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however, brought me to\\nher hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my ship with his\\nthunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades were\\ndrowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried\\nhither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the\\ndarkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island\\nwhere the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me\\nwith the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I\\nmight never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let her do so.\\n\\n\"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good\\nclothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last\\nwhen the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will,\\neither because Jove had told her she must, or because she had changed\\nher mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she provisioned\\nwith abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good stout\\nclothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days seven\\nand ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught sight of\\nthe first outlines of the mountains upon your coast--and glad indeed was\\nI to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much trouble in\\nstore for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no further, and\\nraised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that I\\ncould no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of\\nthe gale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to\\nyour shores.\\n\\n\"There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the\\nwaves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam\\non till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for\\nthere were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I\\ngot out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was\\ncoming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered\\nmyself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off into a\\nvery deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all\\nnight, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke as the sun\\nwas westering, and saw your daughter\\'s maid servants playing upon the\\nbeach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought\\nher aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so\\nthan could be expected from so young a person--for young people are apt\\nto be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she\\nhad had me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you\\nsee me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told\\nyou the whole truth.\"\\n\\nThen Alcinous said, \"Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to\\nbring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she\\nwas the first person whose aid you asked.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do not scold her,\" replied Ulysses; \"she is not to blame. She did\\ntell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid,\\nfor I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human\\nbeing is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.\"\\n\\n\"Stranger,\" replied Alcinous, \"I am not the kind of man to get angry\\nabout nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father Jove,\\nMinerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how\\nmuch you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter,\\nand become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a house and\\nan estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here against your\\nown wish, and that you may be sure of this I will attend tomorrow to the\\nmatter of your escort. You can sleep {64} during the whole voyage if you\\nlike, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own\\nhome, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further\\noff than Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when they took\\nyellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the\\nfurthest of any place--and yet they did the whole voyage in a single day\\nwithout distressing themselves, and came back again afterwards. You\\nwill thus see how much my ships excel all others, and what magnificent\\noarsmen my sailors are.\"\\n\\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, \"Father Jove, grant that\\nAlcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable\\nname among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the\\nroom that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to\\nspread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to\\nwear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when\\nthey had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and said, \"Rise, sir\\nstranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,\" and glad indeed was\\nhe to go to his rest.\\n\\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but\\nAlcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife by\\nhis side.',\n",
       " 'BOOK X\\n\\n  Ulysses and Diomed go out as spies, and meet Dolon, who gives\\n  them information: they then kill him, and profiting by what\\n  he had told them, kill Rhesus king of the Thracians and take\\n  his horses.\\n\\nNOW the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole night\\nthrough, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that he could get\\nno rest. As when fair Juno\\'s lord flashes his lightning in token of\\ngreat rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground, or\\nagain as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry war, even so\\ndid Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled within\\nhim. When he looked upon the plain of Troy he marvelled at the many\\nwatchfires burning in front of Ilius, and at the sound of pipes and\\nflutes and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned towards the\\nships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hair by handfuls before\\nJove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness of his soul.\\nIn the end he deemed it best to go at once to Nestor son of Neleus, and\\nsee if between them they could find any way of the Achaeans from\\ndestruction. He therefore rose, put on his shirt, bound his sandals\\nabout his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawny lion over his\\nshoulders--a skin that reached his feet--and took his spear in his hand.\\n\\nNeither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argives\\nwho for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight the\\nTrojans. He covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther,\\nput a casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawny\\nhand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most\\npowerful of the Achaeans, and was honoured by the people as though he\\nwere a god. He found him by the stern of his ship already putting his\\ngoodly array about his shoulders, and right glad was he that his\\nbrother had come.\\n\\nMenelaus spoke first. \"Why,\" said he, \"my dear brother, are you thus\\narming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit the\\nTrojans? I greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and spy\\nupon the enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed of great\\ndaring.\"\\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Menelaus, we both of us need shrewd\\ncounsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed his\\nmind, and inclines towards Hector\\'s sacrifices rather than ours. I\\nnever saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in one\\nday as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans--and\\nthat too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god nor\\ngoddess. The Argives will rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore, with\\nall speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus.\\nMeanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him rise and go about among the\\ncompanies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; they will\\nlisten to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, and Meriones\\nbrother in arms to Idomeneus, are captains over them. It was to them\\nmore particularly that we gave this charge.\"\\n\\nMenelaus replied, \"How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with them\\nand wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have given\\nyour orders?\" \"Wait,\" answered King Agamemnon, \"for there are so many\\npaths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call every man on\\nyour way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage and by his\\nfather\\'s name, give each all titular observance, and stand not too much\\nupon your own dignity; we must take our full share of toil, for at our\\nbirth Jove laid this heavy burden upon us.\"\\n\\nWith these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went on to\\nNestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his tent hard\\nby his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him--his shield, his two\\nspears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdle with\\nwhich the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his people into\\nbattle--for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his elbow and\\nlooked up at Agamemnon. \"Who is it,\" said he, \"that goes thus about the\\nhost and the ships alone and in the dead of night, when men are\\nsleeping? Are you looking for one of your mules or for some comrade? Do\\nnot stand there and say nothing, but speak. What is your business?\"\\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\\nname, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove has laid labour\\nand sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and my limbs carry me.\\nI am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my eyelids, but my heart\\nis big with war and with the jeopardy of the Achaeans. I am in great\\nfear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and without sure counsel; my heart\\nbeats as though it would leap out of my body, and my limbs fail me. If\\nthen you can do anything--for you too cannot sleep--let us go the round\\nof the watch, and see whether they are drowsy with toil and sleeping to\\nthe neglect of their duty. The enemy is encamped hard and we know not\\nbut he may attack us by night.\"\\n\\nNestor replied, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, Jove\\nwill not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he will; he will have\\ntroubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger. I will go\\nwith you, and we will rouse others, either the son of Tydeus, or\\nUlysses, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Some one had\\nalso better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for their ships are\\nnot near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot however refrain from\\nblaming Menelaus, much as I love him and respect him--and I will say so\\nplainly, even at the risk of offending you--for sleeping and leaving\\nall this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going about imploring aid\\nfrom all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are in extreme danger.\"\\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly, for\\nhe is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself--not indeed from\\nsloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects me\\nto take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before I was,\\nand came to me of his own accord. I have already sent him to call the\\nvery men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We shall find\\nthem with the watch outside the gates, for it was there I said that we\\nwould meet them.\"\\n\\n\"In that case,\" answered Nestor, \"the Argives will not blame him nor\\ndisobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives them\\ninstructions.\"\\n\\nWith this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his comely\\nfeet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large, and of\\na rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and\\nwended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. First he called\\nloudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for he was soon\\nroused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside his tent and\\nsaid, \"Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along the line of\\nthe ships in the stillness of the night? What is it that you find so\\nurgent?\" And Nestor knight of Gerene answered, \"Ulysses, noble son of\\nLaertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great straits. Come\\nwith me and let us wake some other, who may advise well with us whether\\nwe shall fight or fly.\"\\n\\nOn this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about his\\nshoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed son of\\nTydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with his\\ncomrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as for\\ntheir spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts that were\\ndriven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afar like the\\nlightning of father Jove. The hero was sleeping upon the skin of an ox,\\nwith a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor went up to him and\\nstirred him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding him and urging him\\nto bestir himself. \"Wake up,\" he exclaimed, \"son of Tydeus. How can you\\nsleep on in this way? Can you not see that the Trojans are encamped on\\nthe brow of the plain hard by our ships, with but a little space\\nbetween us and them?\"\\n\\nOn these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, \"Old man, your\\nheart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. Are there\\nno younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the\\nprinces? There is no tiring you.\"\\n\\nAnd Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, \"My son, all that you have\\nsaid is true. I have good sons, and also much people who might call the\\nchieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and death\\nare balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Go then, for you are\\nyounger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax and the fleet son of\\nPhyleus.\"\\n\\nDiomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders--a skin\\nthat reached his feet--and grasped his spear. When he had roused the\\nheroes, he brought them back with him; they then went the round of\\nthose who were on guard, and found the captains not sleeping at their\\nposts but wakeful and sitting with their arms about them. As sheep dogs\\nthat watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear a wild beast\\ncoming through the mountain forest towards them--forthwith there is a\\nhue and cry of dogs and men, and slumber is broken--even so was sleep\\nchased from the eyes of the Achaeans as they kept the watches of the\\nwicked night, for they turned constantly towards the plain whenever\\nthey heard any stir among the Trojans. The old man was glad and bade\\nthem be of good cheer. \"Watch on, my children,\" said he, \"and let not\\nsleep get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph over us.\"\\n\\nWith this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of the\\nAchaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the brave son\\nof Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they were beyond\\nthe trench that was dug round the wall they held their meeting on the\\nopen ground where there was a space clear of corpses, for it was here\\nthat when night fell Hector had turned back from his onslaught on the\\nArgives. They sat down, therefore, and held debate with one another.\\n\\nNestor spoke first. \"My friends,\" said he, \"is there any man bold\\nenough to venture among the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or\\nbring us news of what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here\\nby the ships away from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted\\nthe Achaeans, they will retire within their walls. If he could learn\\nall this and come back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven in\\nthe mouths of all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs\\nfrom all our ships would each of them give him a black ewe with her\\nlamb--which is a present of surpassing value--and he would be asked as\\na guest to all feasts and clan-gatherings.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke saying,\\n\"Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans over against us,\\nbut if another will go with me I shall do so in greater confidence and\\ncomfort. When two men are together, one of them may see some\\nopportunity which the other has not caught sight of; if a man is alone\\nhe is less full of resource, and his wit is weaker.\"\\n\\nOn this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes, servants of\\nMars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so did Menelaus\\nson of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the host of the Trojans,\\nfor he was ever full of daring, and thereon Agamemnon king of men spoke\\nthus: \"Diomed,\" said he, \"son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, choose\\nyour comrade for yourself--take the best man of those that have\\noffered, for many would now go with you. Do not through delicacy reject\\nthe better man, and take the worst out of respect for his lineage,\\nbecause he is of more royal blood.\"\\n\\nHe said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, \"If you\\nbid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I fail to\\nthink of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to face all\\nkinds of danger--and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he were to go\\nwith me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is quick to\\nsee and understand.\"\\n\\n\"Son of Tydeus,\" replied Ulysses, \"say neither good nor ill about me,\\nfor you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going, for the\\nnight wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward,\\ntwo-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone left\\nus.\"\\n\\nThey then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son of\\nTydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his ship)\\nand on his head he set a helmet of bull\\'s hide without either peak or\\ncrest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear. Meriones\\nfound a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he set a leathern\\nhelmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathern thongs, while\\non the outside it was thickly studded with boar\\'s teeth, well and\\nskilfully set into it; next the head there was an inner lining of felt.\\nThis helmet had been stolen by Autolycus out of Eleon when he broke\\ninto the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus. He gave it to Amphidamas of\\nCythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift to\\nMolus, who gave it to his son Meriones; and now it was set upon the\\nhead of Ulysses.\\n\\nWhen the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftains\\nbehind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upon their\\nright hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but they heard its\\ncry. Ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed to Minerva: \"Hear\\nme,\" he cried, \"daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you who spy out all my\\nways and who are with me in all my hardships; befriend me in this mine\\nhour, and grant that we may return to the ships covered with glory\\nafter having achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring sorrow to\\nthe Trojans.\"\\n\\nThen Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: \"Hear me too,\" said he,\\n\"daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with my\\nnoble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by the\\nAchaeans. He left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus, and\\nwent to the city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians; on his\\nreturn thence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds of daring,\\nfor you were his ready helper. Even so guide me and guard me now, and\\nin return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year\\nold, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild\\nher horns and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.\"\\n\\nThus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When they had\\ndone praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went their way like\\ntwo lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stained bodies of\\nthem that had fallen.\\n\\nNeither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called the\\nprinces and councillors of the Trojans that he might set his counsel\\nbefore them. \"Is there one,\" said he, \"who for a great reward will do\\nme the service of which I will tell you? He shall be well paid if he\\nwill. I will give him a chariot and a couple of horses, the fleetest\\nthat can be found at the ships of the Achaeans, if he will dare this\\nthing; and he will win infinite honour to boot; he must go to the ships\\nand find out whether they are still guarded as heretofore, or whether\\nnow that we have beaten them the Achaeans design to fly, and through\\nsheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their watches.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certain\\nman named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald--a man rich in gold\\nand bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an only son\\namong five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans. \"I,\\nHector,\" said he, \"Will to the ships and will exploit them. But first\\nhold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me the chariot,\\nbedight with bronze, and the horses that now carry the noble son of\\nPeleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not fail you. I will go\\nthrough the host from one end to the other till I come to the ship of\\nAgamemnon, where I take it the princes of the Achaeans are now\\nconsulting whether they shall fight or fly.\"\\n\\nWhen he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore him his\\noath saying, \"May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bear witness that\\nno other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds, and that you\\nshall have your will with them for ever.\"\\n\\nThe oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on going.\\nHe hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he wore the skin\\nof a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferret skin. Then he\\ntook a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships, but he was not\\nto return with any news for Hector. When he had left the horses and the\\ntroops behind him, he made all speed on his way, but Ulysses perceived\\nhis coming and said to Diomed, \"Diomed, here is some one from the camp;\\nI am not sure whether he is a spy, or whether it is some thief who\\nwould plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a little past us, we\\ncan then spring upon him and take him. If, however, he is too quick for\\nus, go after him with your spear and hem him in towards the ships away\\nfrom the Trojan camp, to prevent his getting back to the town.\"\\n\\nWith this they turned out of their way and lay down among the corpses.\\nDolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he had got about\\nas far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds one that\\nhas been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land quicker than\\noxen) they ran after him, and when he heard their footsteps he stood\\nstill, for he made sure they were friends from the Trojan camp come by\\nHector\\'s orders to bid him return; when, however, they were only a\\nspear\\'s cast, or less, away from him, he saw that they were enemies and ran\\nas fast as his legs could take him. The others gave chase at once, and as\\na couple of well-trained hounds press forward after a doe or hare that\\nruns screaming in front of them, even so did the son of Tydeus and\\nUlysses pursue Dolon and cut him off from his own people. But when he\\nhad fled so far towards the ships that he would soon have fallen in\\nwith the outposts, Minerva infused fresh strength into the son of\\nTydeus for fear some other of the Achaeans might have the glory of\\nbeing first to hit him, and he might himself be only second; he\\ntherefore sprang forward with his spear and said, \"Stand, or I shall\\nthrow my spear, and in that case I shall soon make an end of you.\"\\n\\nHe threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flew over\\nthe man\\'s right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. He stood stock\\nstill, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered, and he turned\\npale with fear. The two came breathless up to him and seized his hands,\\nwhereon he began to weep and said, \"Take me alive; I will ransom\\nmyself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from\\nthis my father will satisfy you with a very large ransom, should he\\nhear of my being alive at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\n\"Fear not,\" replied Ulysses, \"let no thought of death be in your mind;\\nbut tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about alone in\\nthe dead of night away from your camp and towards the ships, while\\nother men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies of the slain, or\\ndid Hector send you to spy out what was going on at the ships? Or did\\nyou come here of your own mere notion?\"\\n\\nDolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: \"Hector, with his vain\\nflattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. He said he\\nwould give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and his\\nbronze-bedizened chariot; he bade me go through the darkness of the\\nflying night, get close to the enemy, and find out whether the ships\\nare still guarded as heretofore, or whether, now that we have beaten\\nthem, the Achaeans design to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are\\nneglecting to keep their watches.\"\\n\\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, \"You had indeed set your heart upon\\na great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus are hardly\\nto be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than Achilles\\nhimself, whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, and tell me true,\\nwhere did you leave Hector when you started? Where lies his armour and\\nhis horses? How, too, are the watches and sleeping-ground of the\\nTrojans ordered? What are their plans? Will they stay here by the ships\\nand away from the city, or now that they have worsted the Achaeans,\\nwill they retire within their walls?\"\\n\\nAnd Dolon answered, \"I will tell you truly all. Hector and the other\\ncouncillors are now holding conference by the monument of great Ilus,\\naway from the general tumult; as for the guards about which you ask me,\\nthere is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host. The Trojans have\\ntheir watchfires, for they are bound to have them; they, therefore, are\\nawake and keep each other to their duty as sentinels; but the allies\\nwho have come from other places are asleep and leave it to the Trojans\\nto keep guard, for their wives and children are not here.\"\\n\\nUlysses then said, \"Now tell me; are they sleeping among the Trojan\\ntroops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may understand it.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you truly all,\" replied Dolon. \"To the seaward lie the\\nCarians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians, and the\\nnoble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians and\\nMeonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask\\nabout all this? If you want to find your way into the host of the\\nTrojans, there are the Thracians, who have lately come here and lie\\napart from the others at the far end of the camp; and they have Rhesus\\nson of Eioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and strongest\\nthat I have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than any\\nwind that blows. His chariot is bedight with silver and gold, and he\\nhas brought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarest\\nworkmanship--too splendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet only\\nfor the gods. Now, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securely\\nhere, until you come back and have proved my words whether they be\\nfalse or true.\"\\n\\nDiomed looked sternly at him and answered, \"Think not, Dolon, for all\\nthe good information you have given us, that you shall escape now you\\nare in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you will come\\nsome second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spy or as an\\nopen enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you will give no more\\ntrouble.\"\\n\\nOn this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him\\nfurther, but Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his sword\\nand cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the dust\\nwhile he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his head,\\nand also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysses hung them\\nup aloft in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, and prayed\\nsaying, \"Accept these, goddess, for we give them to you in preference\\nto all the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us still further towards\\nthe horses and sleeping-ground of the Thracians.\"\\n\\nWith these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk tree,\\nand they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering boughs of\\ntamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through the\\nflying hours of darkness. The two then went onwards amid the fallen\\narmour and the blood, and came presently to the company of Thracian\\nsoldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with their day\\'s toil; their\\ngoodly armour was lying on the ground beside them all orderly in three\\nrows, and each man had his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus was\\nsleeping in the middle, and hard by him his horses were made fast to\\nthe topmost rim of his chariot. Ulysses from some way off saw him and\\nsaid, \"This, Diomed, is the man, and these are the horses about which\\nDolon whom we killed told us. Do your very utmost; dally not about your\\narmour, but loose the horses at once--or else kill the men yourself,\\nwhile I see to the horses.\"\\n\\nThereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smote them\\nright and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were being hacked\\nabout, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion springs\\nfuriously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds them without\\ntheir shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thracian soldiers\\ntill he had killed twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came and drew them\\naside by their feet one by one, that the horses might go forward freely\\nwithout being frightened as they passed over the dead bodies, for they\\nwere not yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus came to the king, he\\nkilled him too (which made thirteen), as he was breathing hard, for by\\nthe counsel of Minerva an evil dream, the seed of Oeneus, hovered that\\nnight over his head. Meanwhile Ulysses untied the horses, made them\\nfast one to another and drove them off, striking them with his bow, for\\nhe had forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. Then he whistled as\\na sign to Diomed.\\n\\nBut Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed he\\nmight accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in which\\nthe king\\'s armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to lift\\nthe armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not kill\\nsome more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came up to\\nhim and said, \"Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may be driven\\nthither, should some other god rouse the Trojans.\"\\n\\nDiomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the\\nhorses. Ulysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to the\\nships of the Achaeans.\\n\\nBut Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the son of\\nTydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of the Trojans he\\nroused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noble kinsman of\\nRhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that the horses were no\\nlonger in their place, and that the men were gasping in their\\ndeath-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend by\\nname. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as the people kept\\nhurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds of the heroes who\\nhad now got away towards the ships.\\n\\nWhen they reached the place where they had killed Hector\\'s scout,\\nUlysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the\\nground, placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses and\\nremounted: then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forward\\nnothing loth towards the ships as though of their own free will. Nestor\\nwas first to hear the tramp of their feet. \"My friends,\" said he,\\n\"princes and counsellors of the Argives, shall I guess right or\\nwrong?--but I must say what I think: there is a sound in my ears as of\\nthe tramp of horses. I hope it may be Diomed and Ulysses driving in\\nhorses from the Trojans, but I much fear that the bravest of the\\nArgives may have come to some harm at their hands.\"\\n\\nHe had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted,\\nwhereon the others shook hands right gladly with them and congratulated\\nthem. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to question them. \"Tell me,\"\\nsaid he, \"renowned Ulysses, how did you two come by these horses? Did\\nyou steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some god meet you and give\\nthem to you? They are like sunbeams. I am well conversant with the\\nTrojans, for old warrior though I am I never hold back by the ships,\\nbut I never yet saw or heard of such horses as these are. Surely some\\ngod must have met you and given them to you, for you are both of you\\ndear to Jove, and to Jove\\'s daughter Minerva.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\\nname, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses than these,\\nfor the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses, however, about\\nwhich you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace. Diomed killed their\\nking with the twelve bravest of his companions. Hard by the ships we\\ntook a thirteenth man--a scout whom Hector and the other Trojans had\\nsent as a spy upon our ships.\"\\n\\nHe laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while the\\nother Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the strongly\\nbuilt quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with thongs\\nof leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stood eating their\\nsweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils of Dolon at the\\nstern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering to\\nMinerva. As for themselves, they went into the sea and washed the sweat\\nfrom their bodies, and from their necks and thighs. When the sea-water\\nhad taken all the sweat from off them, and had refreshed them, they\\nwent into the baths and washed themselves. After they had so done and\\nhad anointed themselves with oil, they sat down to table, and drawing\\nfrom a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering of wine to Minerva.',\n",
       " 'Book XIV\\n\\nULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.\\n\\nUlysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the\\nwooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the\\nplace where Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd, who was\\nthe most thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front of his\\nhut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be\\nseen from far. He had made them spacious {126} and fair to see, with\\na free run for the pigs all round them; he had built them during his\\nmaster\\'s absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,\\nwithout saying anything to Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them\\non top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of\\noaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside he had\\nbuilt twelve styes near one another for the sows to lie in. There were\\nfifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding sows; but the\\nboars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors\\nkept on eating them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he\\nhad continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the\\nherdsman\\'s four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always\\nwith them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of\\nsandals {127} from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out\\nherding the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the fourth to\\ntown with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors that they\\nmight sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.\\n\\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at\\nhim, but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of\\nthe stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn by\\nthem in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide,\\nrushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off\\nby shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to Ulysses, \"Old\\nman, the dogs were likely to have made short work of you, and then you\\nwould have got me into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough\\nworries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in\\ncontinual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people\\nto eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving\\nin some distant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill\\nof bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all about your\\nmisfortunes.\"\\n\\nOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down.\\nHe strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of\\nthis he threw the shaggy chamois skin--a great thick one--on which he\\nused to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome,\\nand said \"May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your heart\\'s\\ndesire in return for the kind way in which you have received me.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Stranger, though a still\\npoorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult him,\\nfor all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what you\\ncan get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have young\\nlords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for heaven has\\nhindered the return of him who would have been always good to me and\\ngiven me something of my own--a house, a piece of land, a good looking\\nwife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who has worked\\nhard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as they have mine\\nin the situation which I hold. If my master had grown old here he would\\nhave done great things by me, but he is gone, and I wish that Helen\\'s\\nwhole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been the death of many a\\ngood man. It was this matter that took my master to Ilius, the land of\\nnoble steeds, to fight the Trojans in the cause of king Agamemnon.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the styes where\\nthe young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought\\nback with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted\\nthem; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before\\nUlysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over\\nwith white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of\\nivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him to begin.\\n\\n\"Fall to, stranger,\" said he, \"on a dish of servant\\'s pork. The fat pigs\\nhave to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple; but\\nthe blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and respect those who do\\nwhat is lawful and right. Even the fierce freebooters who go raiding on\\nother people\\'s land, and Jove gives them their spoil--even they,\\nwhen they have filled their ships and got home again live\\nconscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but some god\\nseems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone; they\\nwill not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their offers of\\nmarriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force, without fear\\nor stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice not\\none victim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for he was\\nexceedingly rich. No other great man either in Ithaca or on the mainland\\nis as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men put together. I will\\ntell you what he had. There are twelve herds of cattle upon the main\\nland, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs,\\nwhile his own men and hired strangers feed him twelve widely spreading\\nherds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even large flocks of goats on\\nthe far end of the island, and they are in the charge of excellent goat\\nherds. Each one of these sends the suitors the best goat in the flock\\nevery day. As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs that you see here,\\nand I have to keep picking out the best I have and sending it to them.\"\\n\\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously\\nwithout a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was\\nsatisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,\\nfilled it with wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and said\\nas he took it in his hands, \"My friend, who was this master of yours\\nthat bought you and paid for you, so rich and so powerful as you tell\\nme? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me who he\\nwas, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and the other gods\\nknow, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have travelled\\nmuch.\"\\n\\nEumaeus answered, \"Old man, no traveller who comes here with news will\\nget Ulysses\\' wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in\\nwant of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a\\nword of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my mistress\\nand tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much of them,\\nand asks them all manner of questions, crying all the time as women will\\nwhen they have lost their husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt\\nand a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty story. But the wolves\\nand birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes\\nof the sea have eaten him, and his bones are lying buried deep in sand\\nupon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it is\\nfor all his friends--for me especially; go where I may I shall never\\nfind so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother and\\nfather where I was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about\\nmy parents now, though I should dearly like to see them again in my own\\ncountry; it is the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot speak\\nof him without reverence though he is here no longer, for he was very\\nfond of me, and took such care of me that wherever he may be I shall\\nalways honour his memory.\"\\n\\n\"My friend,\" replied Ulysses, \"you are very positive, and very hard of\\nbelief about your master\\'s coming home again, nevertheless I will not\\nmerely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything\\nfor my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and\\ncloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will not take\\nanything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I hate hell fire,\\nwho lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swear by king Jove, by the\\nrites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I have now\\ncome, that all will surely happen as I have said it will. Ulysses\\nwill return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the\\nbeginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who\\nare ill treating his wife and son.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Old man, you will neither\\nget paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink\\nyour wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep on\\nreminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks about\\nmy honoured master. As for your oath we will let it alone, but I only\\nwish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his son\\nTelemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about this same boy of his; he was\\nrunning up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be no worse man, face\\nand figure, than his father, but some one, either god or man, has been\\nunsettling his mind, so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get news of\\nhis father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming\\nhome, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in\\nIthaca. But let us say no more about him, and leave him to be taken, or\\nelse to escape if the son of Saturn holds his hand over him to protect\\nhim. And now, old man, tell me your own story; tell me also, for I want\\nto know, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your town\\nand parents, what manner of ship you came in, how crew brought you to\\nIthaca, and from what country they professed to come--for you cannot\\nhave come by land.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"I will tell you all about it. If there were meat\\nand wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to do\\nbut to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I could easily\\ntalk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the story of\\nthe sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to visit me.\\n\\n\"I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well to do man, who had many\\nsons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had\\npurchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax\\n(whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honour among the\\nCretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his sons) put me\\non the same level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock. When,\\nhowever, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided his\\nestate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding\\nand little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry into a rich\\nfamily, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on the field of\\nbattle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw you can see\\nwhat the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to spare. Mars and\\nMinerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my men to surprise the\\nenemy with an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was\\nthe first to leap forward and spear all whom I could overtake. Such was\\nI in battle, but I did not care about farm work, nor the frugal home\\nlife of those who would bring up children. My delight was in ships,\\nfighting, javelins, and arrows--things that most men shudder to think\\nof; but one man likes one thing and another another, and this was what\\nI was most naturally inclined to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy,\\nnine times was I in command of men and ships on foreign service, and I\\namassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first instance,\\nand much more was allotted to me later on.\\n\\n\"My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans,\\nbut when Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many\\nperished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to\\nTroy, and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing\\nso. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked the\\ncity of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it was\\nthat Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily with my\\nchildren, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea of making a\\ndescent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it. I had nine\\nships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I and my men\\nmade feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods\\nand for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board and set sail\\nfrom Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were going down a\\nriver. Nothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had no sickness\\non board, but sat where we were and let the ships go as the wind and\\nsteersmen took them. On the fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus;\\nthere I stationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay by them and\\nkeep guard over them while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every\\npoint of vantage.\\n\\n\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged\\nthe land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and\\nchildren captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they\\nheard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was\\nfilled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the gleam of armour.\\nThen Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the\\nenemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many\\nof us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for them. Jove,\\nhowever, put it in my mind to do thus--and I wish I had died then and\\nthere in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store for me--I\\ntook off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then\\nI went straight up to the king\\'s chariot, clasped his knees and kissed\\nthem, whereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot, and took\\nme weeping to his own home. Many made at me with their ashen spears and\\ntried to kill me in their fury, but the king protected me, for he feared\\nthe wrath of Jove the protector of strangers, who punishes those who do\\nevil.\\n\\n\"I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the\\nEgyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on\\nfor eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who\\nhad already committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over\\ninto going with him to Phoenicia, where his house and his possessions\\nlay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the end of that\\ntime when months and days had gone by till the same season had come\\nround again, he set me on board a ship bound for Libya, on a pretence\\nthat I was to take a cargo along with him to that place, but really that\\nhe might sell me as a slave and take the money I fetched. I suspected\\nhis intention, but went on board with him, for I could not help it.\\n\\n\"The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea\\nthat lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled their\\ndestruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could see\\nnothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our ship and the\\nsea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts and\\nthe ship went round and round and was filled with fire and brimstone\\nas the lightning struck it. The men fell all into the sea; they\\nwere carried about in the water round the ship looking like so many\\nsea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of getting\\nhome again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship\\'s mast\\nwithin my reach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and drifted\\nbefore the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift but in the darkness\\nof the tenth night a great wave bore me on to the Thesprotian coast.\\nThere Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained me hospitably without\\ncharging me anything at all--for his son found me when I was nearly dead\\nwith cold and fatigue, whereon he raised me by the hand, took me to his\\nfather\\'s house and gave me clothes to wear.\\n\\n\"There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he\\nhad entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his\\nhomeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought\\niron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keep his family\\nfor ten generations, so much had he left in the house of king Pheidon.\\nBut the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove\\'s\\nmind from the god\\'s high oak tree, and know whether after so long an\\nabsence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the\\nking swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in his own house as\\nhe did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew found,\\nthat should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before\\nUlysses returned, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing\\nfor the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge\\nof her to be sure and take me safely to King Acastus.\\n\\n\"These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the\\nvery extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from land\\nthey resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the shirt\\nand cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old\\nclouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall, they reached\\nthe tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with a strong rope\\nfast in the ship, while they went on shore to get supper by the sea\\nside. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn my rags\\nover my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I struck out and\\nswam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near a thick wood\\nin which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my having escaped and\\nwent searching about for me, till at last they thought it was no further\\nuse and went back to their ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily,\\nthen took me to a good man\\'s door--for it seems that I am not to die yet\\nawhile.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Poor unhappy stranger, I\\nhave found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but that\\npart about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to believe\\nit. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this way? I know\\nall about the return of my master. The gods one and all of them detest\\nhim, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let him die with\\nfriends around him when the days of his fighting were done; for then the\\nAchaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his son would have\\nbeen heir to his renown, but now the storm winds have spirited him away\\nwe know not whither.\\n\\n\"As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to the\\ntown unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news\\nabout Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those who\\ngrieve over the king\\'s absence, and those who rejoice at it because they\\ncan eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I have\\nnever cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was taken in\\nby an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a long way till at last\\nhe reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He said he had seen\\nUlysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships which had\\nbeen damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the following\\nsummer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back much wealth.\\nAnd now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has brought you to my\\ndoor, do not try to flatter me in this way with vain hopes. It is not\\nfor any such reason that I shall treat you kindly, but only out of\\nrespect for Jove the god of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying\\nyou.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have\\ngiven you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a\\nbargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master\\ncomes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to\\nDulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say he will,\\nset your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder precipice,\\nas a warning to tramps not to go about the country telling lies.\"\\n\\n\"And a pretty figure I should cut then,\" replied Eumaeus, \"both now and\\nhereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and\\nshowing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good earnest\\nif I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will come in\\ndirectly, that we may cook something savoury for supper.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with\\nthe pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a\\ntremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them. But\\nEumaeus called to his men and said, \"Bring in the best pig you have,\\nthat I may sacrifice him for this stranger, and we will take toll of him\\nourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs, while\\nothers reap the fruit of our labour.\"\\n\\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine\\nfat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not\\nforget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the first thing\\nhe did was to cut bristles from the pig\\'s face and throw them into the\\nfire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Ulysses might return\\nhome again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which he had\\nkept back when he was chopping the firewood, and stunned it, while the\\nothers slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and Eumaeus began\\nby putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the fat; these he\\nsprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers; they cut the rest\\nof the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them\\ntill they were done; when they had taken them off the spits they\\nthrew them on to the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most\\nequitable man, then stood up to give every one his share. He made seven\\nportions; one of these he set apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the\\nnymphs, praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men\\nman by man. He gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways down the loin\\nas a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much pleased. \"I hope,\\nEumaeus,\" said he, \"that Jove will be as well disposed towards you as I\\nam, for the respect you are showing to an outcast like myself.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Eat, my good fellow, and\\nenjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,\\njust as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt\\nsacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering,\\nput the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion.\\nMesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had brought this man\\non his own account from among the Taphians during his master\\'s absence,\\nand had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either\\nto his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good\\nthings that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat and\\ndrink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all went\\nto bed after having made a hearty supper.\\n\\nNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It\\npoured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which is\\na wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in the\\nexcellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and give\\nit him, or make one of his men give him one. \"Listen to me,\" said he,\\n\"Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell you\\nsomething. It is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will make\\neven a wise man fall to singing; it will make him chuckle and dance\\nand say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as I have\\nbegun, I will go on. Would that I were still young and strong as when we\\ngot up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the leaders,\\nbut I was in command also, for the other two would have it so. When we\\nhad come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our armour\\nand lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood that grew\\nabout the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the\\nsnow fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated\\nthick with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept\\ncomfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders, but I had\\ncarelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be too\\ncold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When the\\nnight was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted their places, I\\nnudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and he at once gave me\\nhis ear.\\n\\n\"\\'Ulysses,\\' said I, \\'this cold will be the death of me, for I have no\\ncloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my shirt,\\nand I do not know what to do.\\'\\n\\n\"Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following\\nplan:\\n\\n\"\\'Keep still,\\' said he in a low voice, \\'or the others will hear you.\\'\\nThen he raised his head on his elbow.\\n\\n\"\\'My friends,\\' said he, \\'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We\\nare a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell\\nAgamemnon to send us up more men at once.\\'\\n\\n\"On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running\\nto the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough\\ntill morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in those\\ndays, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak both out\\nof good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier; but now people\\nlook down upon me because my clothes are shabby.\"\\n\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \"Old man, you have told us an excellent story,\\nand have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the\\npresent, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else\\nthat a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning\\nyou have to shake your own old rags about your body again, for we have\\nnot many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has only one.\\nWhen Ulysses\\' son comes home again he will give you both cloak and\\nshirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.\"\\n\\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some\\ngoatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here\\nUlysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak\\nthat he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.\\n\\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the\\nswineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready\\nto go outside, and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his\\nproperty during his master\\'s absence. First he slung his sword over his\\nbrawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also\\ntook the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of\\nattack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where the\\npigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from\\nthe North wind.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XXI\\n\\n  The fight between Achilles and the river Scamander--The gods\\n  fight among themselves--Achilles drives the Trojans within\\n  their gates.\\n\\nNOW when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus,\\nbegotten of immortal Jove, Achilles cut their forces in two: one half\\nhe chased over the plain towards the city by the same way that the\\nAchaeans had taken when flying panic-stricken on the preceding day with\\nHector in full triumph; this way did they fly pell-mell, and Juno sent\\ndown a thick mist in front of them to stay them. The other half were\\nhemmed in by the deep silver-eddying stream, and fell into it with a\\ngreat uproar. The waters resounded, and the banks rang again, as they\\nswam hither and thither with loud cries amid the whirling eddies. As\\nlocusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire--the flame\\ncomes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they huddle into the\\nwater--even so was the eddying stream of Xanthus filled with the uproar\\nof men and horses, all struggling in confusion before Achilles.\\n\\nForthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it against a\\ntamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god, armed with his\\nsword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed the Trojans down on every\\nside. Their dying groans rose hideous as the sword smote them, and the\\nriver ran red with blood. As when fish fly scared before a huge\\ndolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some fair haven--for he is\\nsure to eat all he can catch--even so did the Trojans cower under the\\nbanks of the mighty river, and when Achilles\\' arms grew weary with\\nkilling them, he drew twelve youths alive out of the water, to\\nsacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son of Menoetius. He drew them out\\nlike dazed fawns, bound their hands behind them with the girdles of\\ntheir own shirts, and gave them over to his men to take back to the\\nships. Then he sprang into the river, thirsting for still further blood.\\n\\nThere he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he was\\nescaping out of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisoner\\nwhen he was in his father\\'s vineyard, having set upon him by night, as\\nhe was cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wicker\\nsides of a chariot. Achilles then caught him to his sorrow unawares,\\nand sent him by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him. But a\\nguest-friend, Eetion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum, and sent\\nhim to Arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to his father\\'s\\nhouse. He had spent eleven days happily with his friends after he had\\ncome from Lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven again delivered him into\\nthe hands of Achilles, who was to send him to the house of Hades sorely\\nagainst his will. He was unarmed when Achilles caught sight of him, and\\nhad neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he any spear, for he had\\nthrown all his armour from him on to the bank, and was sweating with\\nhis struggles to get out of the river, so that his strength was now\\nfailing him.\\n\\nThen Achilles said to himself in his surprise, \"What marvel do I see\\nhere? If this man can come back alive after having been sold over into\\nLemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain rising from the\\nworld below. Could not even the waters of the grey sea imprison him, as\\nthey do many another whether he will or no? This time let him taste my\\nspear, that I may know for certain whether mother earth who can keep\\neven a strong man down, will be able to hold him, or whether thence too\\nhe will return.\"\\n\\nThus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed and\\ntrying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die.\\nAchilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lycaon\\nran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passed\\nover his back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was for\\nblood. With one hand he caught Achilles\\' knees as he besought him, and\\nwith the other he clutched the spear and would not let it go. Then he\\nsaid, \"Achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for I am your\\nsuppliant. It was in your tents that I first broke bread on the day\\nwhen you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you sold me away\\nto Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I brought you the\\nprice of a hundred oxen. I have paid three times as much to gain my\\nfreedom; it is but twelve days that I have come to Ilius after much\\nsuffering, and now cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands.\\nSurely father Jove must hate me, that he has given me over to you a\\nsecond time. Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me,\\ndaughter of aged Altes--of Altes who reigns over the warlike Lelegae\\nand holds steep Pedasus on the river Satnioeis. Priam married his\\ndaughter along with many other women and two sons were born of her,\\nboth of whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydorus as he\\nwas fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befall me, for\\nI fear that I shall not escape you since heaven has delivered me over\\nto you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, spare me,\\nfor I am not of the same womb as Hector who slew your brave and noble\\ncomrade.\"\\n\\nWith such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles; but\\nAchilles answered him sternly. \"Idiot,\" said he, \"talk not to me of\\nransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the Trojans quarter,\\nand sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive; but now\\nnot a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my hands before\\nthe city of Ilius--and of all Trojans it shall fare hardest with the\\nsons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shall die. Why should you\\nwhine in this way? Patroclus fell, and he was a better man than you\\nare. I too--see you not how I am great and goodly? I am son to a noble\\nfather, and have a goddess for my mother, but the hands of doom and\\ndeath overshadow me all as surely. The day will come, either at dawn or\\ndark, or at the noontide, when one shall take my life also in battle,\\neither with his spear, or with an arrow sped from his bow.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and Lycaon\\'s heart sank within him. He loosed his\\nhold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but Achilles\\ndrew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck; he\\nplunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon he lay\\nat full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from him till\\nthe earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot and flung\\nhim into the river to go down stream, vaunting over him the while, and\\nsaying, \"Lie there among the fishes, who will lick the blood from your\\nwound and gloat over it; your mother shall not lay you on any bier to\\nmourn you, but the eddies of Scamander shall bear you into the broad\\nbosom of the sea. There shall the fishes feed on the fat of Lycaon as\\nthey dart under the dark ripple of the waters--so perish all of you\\ntill we reach the citadel of strong Ilius--you in flight, and I\\nfollowing after to destroy you. The river with its broad silver stream\\nshall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls you offered him and all\\nthe horses that you flung living into his waters. None the less\\nmiserably shall you perish till there is not a man of you but has paid\\nin full for the death of Patroclus and the havoc you wrought among the\\nAchaeans whom you have slain while I held aloof from battle.\"\\n\\nSo spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and pondered\\nwithin himself how he should stay the hand of Achilles and save the\\nTrojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spear in hand,\\nsprang upon Asteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill him. He was son to the\\nbroad river Axius and Periboea eldest daughter of Acessamenus; for the\\nriver had lain with her. Asteropaeus stood up out of the water to face\\nhim with a spear in either hand, and Xanthus filled him with courage,\\nbeing angry for the death of the youths whom Achilles was slaying\\nruthlessly within his waters. When they were close up with one another\\nAchilles was first to speak. \"Who and whence are you,\" said he, \"who\\ndare to face me? Woe to the parents whose son stands up against me.\"\\nAnd the son of Pelegon answered, \"Great son of Peleus, why should you\\nask my lineage. I am from the fertile land of far Paeonia, captain of\\nthe Paeonians, and it is now eleven days that I am at Ilius. I am of\\nthe blood of the river Axius--of Axius that is the fairest of all\\nrivers that run. He begot the famed warrior Pelegon, whose son men call\\nme. Let us now fight, Achilles.\"\\n\\nThus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash.\\nAsteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use both hands\\nalike; with the one spear he struck Achilles\\' shield, but did not\\npierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point;\\nwith the other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles\\' right arm drawing\\ndark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixed itself in the\\nground, foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles, fain to kill him,\\nhurled his spear at Asteropaeus, but failed to hit him and struck the\\nsteep bank of the river, driving the spear half its length into the\\nearth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword and sprang furiously upon\\nhim. Asteropaeus vainly tried to draw Achilles\\' spear out of the bank\\nby main force; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might to\\ndraw it out, and thrice he had to leave off trying; the fourth time he\\ntried to bend and break it, but ere he could do so Achilles smote him\\nwith his sword and killed him. He struck him in the belly near the\\nnavel, so that all his bowels came gushing out on to the ground, and\\nthe darkness of death came over him as he lay gasping. Then Achilles\\nset his foot on his chest and spoiled him of his armour, vaunting over\\nhim and saying, \"Lie there--begotten of a river though you be, it is\\nhard for you to strive with the offspring of Saturn\\'s son. You declare\\nyourself sprung from the blood of a broad river, but I am of the seed\\nof mighty Jove. My father is Peleus, son of Aeacus ruler over the many\\nMyrmidons, and Aeacus was the son of Jove. Therefore as Jove is\\nmightier than any river that flows into the sea, so are his children\\nstronger than those of any river whatsoever. Moreover you have a great\\nriver hard by if he can be of any use to you, but there is no fighting\\nagainst Jove the son of Saturn, with whom not even King Achelous can\\ncompare, nor the mighty stream of deep-flowing Oceanus, from whom all\\nrivers and seas with all springs and deep wells proceed; even Oceanus\\nfears the lightnings of great Jove, and his thunder that comes crashing\\nout of heaven.\"\\n\\nWith this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that he had\\nkilled Asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the sand, with the\\ndark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busy nibbling and\\ngnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. Then he went in chase of\\nthe Paeonians, who were flying along the bank of the river in panic\\nwhen they saw their leader slain by the hands of the son of Peleus.\\nTherein he slew Thersilochus, Mydon, Astypylus, Mnesus, Thrasius,\\nOeneus, and Ophelestes, and he would have slain yet others, had not the\\nriver in anger taken human form, and spoken to him from out the deep\\nwaters saying, \"Achilles, if you excel all in strength, so do you also\\nin wickedness, for the gods are ever with you to protect you: if, then,\\nthe son of Saturn has vouchsafed it to you to destroy all the Trojans,\\nat any rate drive them out of my stream, and do your grim work on land.\\nMy fair waters are now filled with corpses, nor can I find any channel\\nby which I may pour myself into the sea for I am choked with dead, and\\nyet you go on mercilessly slaying. I am in despair, therefore, O\\ncaptain of your host, trouble me no further.\"\\n\\nAchilles answered, \"So be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but I will\\nnever cease dealing out death among the Trojans, till I have pent them\\nup in their city, and made trial of Hector face to face, that I may\\nlearn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of the gods.\\nBut the river said to Apollo, \"Surely, son of Jove, lord of the silver\\nbow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who charged you straitly\\nthat you should stand by the Trojans and defend them, till twilight\\nfades, and darkness is over the earth.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon the\\nriver raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his stream into a\\ntorrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slain and left\\nwithin his waters. These he cast out on to the land, bellowing like a\\nbull the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding them in his\\nmighty eddies. The great and terrible wave gathered about Achilles,\\nfalling upon him and beating on his shield, so that he could not keep\\nhis feet; he caught hold of a great elm-tree, but it came up by the\\nroots, and tore away the bank, damming the stream with its thick\\nbranches and bridging it all across; whereby Achilles struggled out of\\nthe stream, and fled full speed over the plain, for he was afraid.\\n\\nBut the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him with\\na dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the Trojans from\\ndestruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear\\'s throw from him;\\nswift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongest and\\nfleetest of all birds, even so did he spring forward, and the armour\\nrang loudly about his breast. He fled on in front, but the river with a\\nloud roar came tearing after. As one who would water his garden leads a\\nstream from some fountain over his plants, and all his ground--spade in\\nhand he clears away the dams to free the channels, and the little\\nstones run rolling round and round with the water as it goes merrily\\ndown the bank faster than the man can follow--even so did the river\\nkeep catching up with Achilles albeit he was a fleet runner, for the\\ngods are stronger than men. As often as he would strive to stand his\\nground, and see whether or no all the gods in heaven were in league\\nagainst him, so often would the mighty wave come beating down upon his\\nshoulders, and he would have to keep flying on and on in great dismay;\\nfor the angry flood was tiring him out as it flowed past him and ate\\nthe ground from under his feet.\\n\\nThen the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, \"Father\\nJove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and save me\\nfrom the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards. I blame\\nnone of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do my dear\\nmother, who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was to fall\\nunder the walls of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; would that\\nHector, the best man among the Trojans, might there slay me; then\\nshould I fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seems that I\\nshall come to a most pitiable end, trapped in this river as though I\\nwere some swineherd\\'s boy, who gets carried down a torrent while trying\\nto cross it during a storm.\"\\n\\nAs soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him in\\nthe likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him.\\nNeptune spoke first. \"Son of Peleus,\" said he, \"be not so exceeding\\nfearful; we are two gods, come with Jove\\'s sanction to assist you, I,\\nand Pallas Minerva. It is not your fate to perish in this river; he\\nwill abate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise you,\\nif you will be guided by us, not to stay your hand from fighting till\\nyou have pent the Trojan host within the famed walls of Ilius--as many\\nof them as may escape. Then kill Hector and go back to the ships, for\\nwe will vouchsafe you a triumph over him.\"\\n\\nWhen they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but\\nAchilles strove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge the\\ngods had laid upon him. All was now covered with the flood of waters,\\nand much goodly armour of the youths that had been slain was rifting\\nabout, as also many corpses, but he forced his way against the stream,\\nspeeding right onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him, for\\nMinerva had endowed him with great strength. Nevertheless Scamander did\\nnot slacken in his pursuit, but was still more furious with the son of\\nPeleus. He lifted his waters into a high crest and cried aloud to\\nSimois saying, \"Dear brother, let the two of us unite to save this man,\\nor he will sack the mighty city of King Priam, and the Trojans will not\\nhold out against him. Help me at once; fill your streams with water\\nfrom their sources, rouse all your torrents to a fury; raise your wave\\non high, and let snags and stones come thundering down you that we may\\nmake an end of this savage creature who is now lording it as though he\\nwere a god. Nothing shall serve him longer, not strength nor\\ncomeliness, nor his fine armour, which forsooth shall soon be lying low\\nin the deep waters covered over with mud. I will wrap him in sand, and\\npour tons of shingle round him, so that the Achaeans shall not know how\\nto gather his bones for the silt in which I shall have hidden him, and\\nwhen they celebrate his funeral they need build no barrow.\"\\n\\nOn this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles,\\nseething as it was with foam and blood and the bodies of the dead. The\\ndark waters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmed the\\nson of Peleus, but Juno, trembling lest Achilles should be swept away\\nin the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out to\\nVulcan her son. \"Crook-foot,\" she cried, \"my child, be up and doing,\\nfor I deem it is with you that Xanthus is fain to fight; help us at\\nonce, kindle a fierce fire; I will then bring up the west and the white\\nsouth wind in a mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bear the\\nflames against the heads and armour of the Trojans and consume them,\\nwhile you go along the banks of Xanthus burning his trees and wrapping\\nhim round with fire. Let him not turn you back neither by fair words\\nnor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Then you may stay\\nyour flames.\"\\n\\nOn this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon the\\nplain and burned the many dead whom Achilles had killed and whose\\nbodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plain was\\ndried and the flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing on an orchard\\nthat has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, and the heart of\\nthe owner is glad--even so the whole plain was dried and the dead\\nbodies were consumed. Then he turned tongues of fire on to the river.\\nHe burned the elms the willows and the tamarisks, the lotus also, with\\nthe rushes and marshy herbage that grew abundantly by the banks of the\\nriver. The eels and fishes that go darting about everywhere in the\\nwater, these, too, were sorely harassed by the flames that cunning\\nVulcan had kindled, and the river himself was scalded, so that he spoke\\nsaying, \"Vulcan, there is no god can hold his own against you. I cannot\\nfight you when you flare out your flames in this way; strive with me no\\nlonger. Let Achilles drive the Trojans out of their city immediately.\\nWhat have I to do with quarrelling and helping people?\"\\n\\nHe was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As a\\ncauldron upon a large fire boils when it is melting the lard of some\\nfatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the dry\\nfaggots blaze under it--even so were the goodly waters of Xanthus\\nheated with the fire till they were boiling. He could flow no longer\\nbut stayed his stream, so afflicted was he by the blasts of fire which\\ncunning Vulcan had raised. Then he prayed to Juno and besought her\\nsaying, \"Juno, why should your son vex my stream with such especial\\nfury? I am not so much to blame as all the others are who have been\\nhelping the Trojans. I will leave off, since you so desire it, and let\\nyour son leave off also. Furthermore I swear never again will I do\\nanything to save the Trojans from destruction, not even when all Troy\\nis burning in the flames which the Achaeans will kindle.\"\\n\\nAs soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, \"Son Vulcan,\\nhold now your flames; we ought not to use such violence against a god\\nfor the sake of mortals.\"\\n\\nWhen she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the river went\\nback once more into his own fair bed.\\n\\nXanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Juno stayed\\nthem though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel broke out among\\nthe other gods, for they were of divided counsels. They fell on one\\nanother with a mighty uproar--earth groaned, and the spacious firmament\\nrang out as with a blare of trumpets. Jove heard as he was sitting on\\nOlympus, and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows among\\nthemselves. They were not long about beginning, and Mars piercer of\\nshields opened the battle. Sword in hand he sprang at once upon Minerva\\nand reviled her. \"Why, vixen,\" said he, \"have you again set the gods by\\nthe ears in the pride and haughtiness of your heart? Have you forgotten\\nhow you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to wound me, and yourself took\\nvisible spear and drove it into me to the hurt of my fair body? You\\nshall now suffer for what you then did to me.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis--so terrible\\nthat not even can Jove\\'s lightning pierce it. Here did murderous Mars\\nstrike her with his great spear. She drew back and with her strong hand\\nseized a stone that was lying on the plain--great and rugged and\\nblack--which men of old had set for the boundary of a field. With this\\nshe struck Mars on the neck, and brought him down. Nine roods did he\\ncover in his fall, and his hair was all soiled in the dust, while his\\narmour rang rattling round him. But Minerva laughed and vaunted over\\nhim saying, \"Idiot, have you not learned how far stronger I am than\\nyou, but you must still match yourself against me? Thus do your\\nmother\\'s curses now roost upon you, for she is angry and would do you\\nmischief because you have deserted the Achaeans and are helping the\\nTrojans.\"\\n\\nShe then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove\\'s\\ndaughter Venus took Mars by the hand and led him away groaning all the\\ntime, for it was only with great difficulty that he had come to himself\\nagain. When Queen Juno saw her, she said to Minerva, \"Look, daughter of\\naegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that vixen Venus is again taking Mars\\nthrough the crowd out of the battle; go after her at once.\"\\n\\nThus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made at her,\\nstriking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she fell\\nfainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at full\\nlength. Then Minerva vaunted over her saying, \"May all who help the\\nTrojans against the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart as\\nVenus did when she came across me while she was helping Mars. Had this\\nbeen so, we should long since have ended the war by sacking the strong\\ncity of Ilius.\"\\n\\nJuno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollo\\nsaying, \"Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm\\'s length? it is\\nnot well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will be\\ndisgraceful to us if we return to Jove\\'s bronze-floored mansion on\\nOlympus without having fought each other; therefore come on, you are\\nthe younger of the two, and I ought not to attack you, for I am older\\nand have had more experience. Idiot, you have no sense, and forget how\\nwe two alone of all the gods fared hardly round about Ilius when we\\ncame from Jove\\'s house and worked for Laomedon a whole year at a stated\\nwage and he gave us his orders. I built the Trojans the wall about\\ntheir city, so wide and fair that it might be impregnable, while you,\\nPhoebus, herded cattle for him in the dales of many valleyed Ida. When,\\nhowever, the glad hours brought round the time of payment, mighty\\nLaomedon robbed us of all our hire and sent us off with nothing but\\nabuse. He threatened to bind us hand and foot and sell us over into\\nsome distant island. He tried, moreover, to cut off the ears of both of\\nus, so we went away in a rage, furious about the payment he had\\npromised us, and yet withheld; in spite of all this, you are now\\nshowing favour to his people, and will not join us in compassing the\\nutter ruin of the proud Trojans with their wives and children.\"\\n\\nAnd King Apollo answered, \"Lord of the earthquake, you would have no\\nrespect for me if I were to fight you about a pack of miserable\\nmortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of the\\nfield, and presently fall lifeless to the ground. Let us stay this\\nfighting at once and let them settle it among themselves.\"\\n\\nHe turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the brother of\\nhis own father. But his sister the huntress Diana, patroness of wild\\nbeasts, was very angry with him and said, \"So you would fly,\\nFar-Darter, and hand victory over to Neptune with a cheap vaunt to\\nboot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again hear you\\nbragging in my father\\'s house, as you have often done in the presence\\nof the immortals, that you would stand up and fight with Neptune.\"\\n\\nApollo made her no answer, but Jove\\'s august queen was angry and\\nupbraided her bitterly. \"Bold vixen,\" she cried, \"how dare you cross me\\nthus? For all your bow you will find it hard to hold your own against\\nme. Jove made you as a lion among women, and lets you kill them\\nwhenever you choose. You will find it better to chase wild beasts and\\ndeer upon the mountains than to fight those who are stronger than you\\nare. If you would try war, do so, and find out by pitting yourself\\nagainst me, how far stronger I am than you are.\"\\n\\nShe caught both Diana\\'s wrists with her left hand as she spoke, and\\nwith her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed as she\\nbeat her with it about the ears while Diana wriggled and writhed under\\nher blows. Her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and she fled\\nweeping from under Juno\\'s hand as a dove that flies before a falcon to\\nthe cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune to escape.\\nEven so did she fly weeping away, leaving her bow and arrows behind her.\\n\\nThen the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto, \"Leto, I\\nshall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Jove\\'s\\nwives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that you worsted\\nme in fair fight.\"\\n\\nLeto then gathered up Diana\\'s bow and arrows that had fallen about amid\\nthe whirling dust, and when she had got them she made all haste after\\nher daughter. Diana had now reached Jove\\'s bronze-floored mansion on\\nOlympus, and sat herself down with many tears on the knees of her\\nfather, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering all about her. The\\nson of Saturn drew her towards him, and laughing pleasantly the while\\nbegan to question her saying, \"Which of the heavenly beings, my dear\\nchild, has been treating you in this cruel manner, as though you had\\nbeen misconducting yourself in the face of everybody?\" and the\\nfair-crowned goddess of the chase answered, \"It was your wife Juno,\\nfather, who has been beating me; it is always her doing when there is\\nany quarrelling among the immortals.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered the strong\\ncity of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not hold out and\\nthe Danaans should take the city then and there, before its hour had\\ncome; but the rest of the ever-living gods went back, some angry and\\nsome triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seats beside Jove\\nlord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept on dealing out death\\nalike on the Trojans and on their horses. As when the smoke from some\\nburning city ascends to heaven when the anger of the gods has kindled\\nit--there is then toil for all, and sorrow for not a few--even so did\\nAchilles bring toil and sorrow on the Trojans.\\n\\nOld King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on huge\\nAchilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and there was\\nnone to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower and with\\nmany a groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave warders of\\nthe gate. \"Keep the gates,\" said he, \"wide open till the people come\\nflying into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is driving them in\\nrout before him. I see we are in great peril. As soon as our people are\\ninside and in safety, close the strong gates for I fear lest that\\nterrible man should come bounding inside along with the others.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and when\\nthese were opened there was a haven of refuge for the Trojans. Apollo\\nthen came full speed out of the city to meet them and protect them.\\nRight for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst and grimy\\nwith dust, still they fied on, with Achilles wielding his spear\\nfuriously behind them. For he was as one possessed, and was thirsting\\nafter glory.\\n\\nThen had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy if\\nApollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to Antenor. He\\nput courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him, leaning\\nagainst a beech tree and shrouded in thick darkness. When Agenor saw\\nAchilles he stood still and his heart was clouded with care. \"Alas,\"\\nsaid he to himself in his dismay, \"if I fly before mighty Achilles, and\\ngo where all the others are being driven in rout, he will none the less\\ncatch me and kill me for a coward. How would it be were I to let\\nAchilles drive the others before him, and then fly from the wall to the\\nplain that is behind Ilius till I reach the spurs of Ida and can hide\\nin the underwood that is thereon? I could then wash the sweat from off\\nme in the river and in the evening return to Ilius. But why commune\\nwith myself in this way? Like enough he would see me as I am hurrying\\nfrom the city over the plain, and would speed after me till he had\\ncaught me--I should stand no chance against him, for he is mightiest of\\nall mankind. What, then, if I go out and meet him in front of the city?\\nHis flesh too, I take it, can be pierced by pointed bronze. Life is the\\nsame in one and all, and men say that he is but mortal despite the\\ntriumph that Jove son of Saturn vouchsafes him.\"\\n\\nSo saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was now\\nfain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covert\\nto attack a hunter--she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the baying\\nof the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her and wound her\\neither with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has pierced her\\nshe will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip or been\\nkilled outright--even so did noble Agenor son of Antenor refuse to fly\\ntill he had made trial of Achilles, and took aim at him with his spear,\\nholding his round shield before him and crying with a loud voice. \"Of a\\ntruth,\" said he, \"noble Achilles, you deem that you shall this day sack\\nthe city of the proud Trojans. Fool, there will be trouble enough yet\\nbefore it, for there is many a brave man of us still inside who will\\nstand in front of our dear parents with our wives and children, to\\ndefend Ilius. Here therefore, huge and mighty warrior though you be,\\nhere shall you die.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the spear\\nstruck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newly\\nwrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of him\\nwhom it had struck, and did not pierce it, for the god\\'s gift stayed\\nit. Achilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would not\\nvouchsafe him glory, for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in a thick\\nmist, sending him out of the battle unmolested. Then he craftily drew\\nthe son of Peleus away from going after the host, for he put on the\\nsemblance of Agenor and stood in front of Achilles, who ran towards him\\nto give him chase and pursued him over the corn lands of the plain,\\nturning him towards the deep waters of the river Scamander. Apollo ran\\nbut a little way before him and beguiled Achilles by making him think\\nall the time that he was on the point of overtaking him. Meanwhile the\\nrabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd within the city till\\ntheir numbers thronged it; no longer did they dare wait for one another\\noutside the city walls, to learn who had escaped and who were fallen in\\nfight, but all whose feet and knees could still carry them poured\\npell-mell into the town.']"
