       "['BOOK XIV\\n\\n  Agamemnon proposes that the Achaeans should sail home, and\\n  is rebuked by Ulysses--Juno beguiles Jupiter--Hector is\\n  wounded.\\n\\nNESTOR was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not escape\\nhim, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, \"What, noble Machaon, is\\nthe meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by our ships grow\\nstronger and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit over your wine,\\nwhile fair Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clotted blood from\\noff you. I will go at once to the look-out station and see what it is\\nall about.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was lying\\nin his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had taken his\\nfather\\'s shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and as\\nsoon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans who, now\\nthat their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before the\\nTrojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the waves are\\ndumb--they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter whence the\\nfierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where they are and set\\nneither this way nor that, till some particular wind sweeps down from\\nheaven to determine them--even so did the old man ponder whether to\\nmake for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search of Agamemnon. In the end\\nhe deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus; but meanwhile the hosts\\nwere fighting and killing one another, and the hard bronze rattled on\\ntheir bodies, as they thrust at one another with their swords and\\nspears.\\n\\nThe wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son of\\nAtreus, fell in with Nestor as they were coming up from their\\nships--for theirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was\\ngoing on, being on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached\\nfirst, while the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch\\nof the shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all the\\nships, and the host was cramped for space, therefore they had placed\\nthe ships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the whole\\nopening of the bay between the two points that formed it. The kings,\\nleaning on their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being in\\ngreat anxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled with\\ndismay. Then King Agamemnon said to him, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour\\nto the Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? I\\nfear that what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted among\\nthe Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had fired\\nour ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is all coming\\ntrue. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles, are in such anger with\\nme that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships.\"\\n\\nThen Nestor knight of Gerene, answered, \"It is indeed as you say; it is\\nall coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thunders from on high\\ncannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we relied as an\\nimpregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. The Trojans are fighting\\nstubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look where you may you\\ncannot see from what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming; they\\nare being killed in a confused mass and the battle-cry ascends to\\nheaven; let us think, if counsel can be of any use, what we had better\\ndo; but I do not advise our going into battle ourselves, for a man\\ncannot fight when he is wounded.\"\\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed\\nfighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench\\nhas served us--over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they\\ndeemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet--I see\\nit must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish\\ningloriously here, far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing to\\ndefend us, and I know now that he is raising the Trojans to like honour\\nwith the gods, while us, on the other hand, he has bound hand and foot.\\nNow, therefore, let us all do as I say; let us bring down the ships\\nthat are on the beach and draw them into the water; let us make them\\nfast to their mooring-stones a little way out, against the fall of\\nnight--if even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting; we may\\nthen draw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong in flying\\nruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should fly and be\\nsaved than be caught and killed.\"\\n\\nUlysses looked fiercely at him and said, \"Son of Atreus, what are you\\ntalking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other and baser\\narmy, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted a life of\\nhard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of us perish. Is\\nit thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win which we have\\nsuffered so much hardship? Hold your peace, lest some other of the\\nAchaeans hear you say what no man who knows how to give good counsel,\\nno king over so great a host as that of the Argives should ever have\\nlet fall from his lips. I despise your judgement utterly for what you\\nhave been saying. Would you, then, have us draw down our ships into the\\nwater while the battle is raging, and thus play further into the hands\\nof the conquering Trojans? It would be ruin; the Achaeans will not go\\non fighting when they see the ships being drawn into the water, but\\nwill cease attacking and keep turning their eyes towards them; your\\ncounsel, therefore, sir captain, would be our destruction.\"\\n\\nAgamemnon answered, \"Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart. I\\nam not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships into the sea\\nwhether they will or no. Someone, it may be, old or young, can offer us\\nbetter counsel which I shall rejoice to hear.\"\\n\\nThen said Diomed, \"Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek, if\\nyou will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am younger\\nthan any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who lies\\nburied at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom,\\nAgrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third was the\\nknight Oeneus, my father\\'s father, and he was the most valiant of them\\nall. Oeneus remained in his own country, but my father (as Jove and the\\nother gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He married into the family\\nof Adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance, for he had large\\nestates of rich corn-growing land, with much orchard ground as well,\\nand he had many sheep; moreover he excelled all the Argives in the use\\nof the spear. You must yourselves have heard whether these things are\\ntrue or no; therefore when I say well despise not my words as though I\\nwere a coward or of ignoble birth. I say, then, let us go to the fight\\nas we needs must, wounded though we be. When there, we may keep out of\\nthe battle and beyond the range of the spears lest we get fresh wounds\\nin addition to what we have already, but we can spur on others, who\\nhave been indulging their spleen and holding aloof from battle\\nhitherto.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out,\\nKing Agamemnon leading the way.\\n\\nMeanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them in\\nthe semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon\\'s right hand in his own\\nand said, \"Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that he sees\\nthe Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse--may\\nhe come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself, the\\nblessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the\\nprinces and counsellors of the Trojans shall again raise the dust upon\\nthe plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tents\\ntowards their city.\"\\n\\nWith this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to the\\nplain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nine or\\nten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight, and it\\nput fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage war and do\\nbattle without ceasing.\\n\\nJuno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of\\nOlympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was at once\\nher brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither amid\\nthe fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on the topmost\\ncrests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She set herself to\\nthink how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemed that it\\nwould be best for her to go to Ida and array herself in rich attire, in\\nthe hope that Jove might become enamoured of her, and wish to embrace\\nher. While he was thus engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be made\\nto steal over his eyes and senses.\\n\\nShe went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made her, and\\nthe doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of a secret key\\nso that no other god could open them. Here she entered and closed the\\ndoors behind her. She cleansed all the dirt from her fair body with\\nambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil, ambrosial, very\\nsoft, and scented specially for herself--if it were so much as shaken\\nin the bronze-floored house of Jove, the scent pervaded the universe of\\nheaven and earth. With this she anointed her delicate skin, and then\\nshe plaited the fair ambrosial locks that flowed in a stream of golden\\ntresses from her immortal head. She put on the wondrous robe which\\nMinerva had worked for her with consummate art, and had embroidered\\nwith manifold devices; she fastened it about her bosom with golden\\nclasps, and she girded herself with a girdle that had a hundred\\ntassels: then she fastened her earrings, three brilliant pendants that\\nglistened most beautifully, through the pierced lobes of her ears, and\\nthrew a lovely new veil over her head. She bound her sandals on to her\\nfeet, and when she had arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction,\\nshe left her room and called Venus to come aside and speak to her. \"My\\ndear child,\" said she, \"will you do what I am going to ask of you, or\\nwill you refuse me because you are angry at my being on the Danaan\\nside, while you are on the Trojan?\"\\n\\nJove\\'s daughter Venus answered, \"Juno, august queen of goddesses,\\ndaughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it for you\\nat once, if I can, and if it can be done at all.\"\\n\\nThen Juno told her a lying tale and said, \"I want you to endow me with\\nsome of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring all things\\nmortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world\\'s end to\\nvisit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys: they\\nreceived me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up, having\\ntaken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn in the\\ndepths that are under earth and sea. I must go and see them that I may\\nmake peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and are so angry\\nthat they have not slept with one another this long while; if I can\\nbring them round and restore them to one another\\'s embraces, they will\\nbe grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards.\"\\n\\nThereon laughter-loving Venus said, \"I cannot and must not refuse you,\\nfor you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered girdle\\ninto which all her charms had been wrought--love, desire, and that\\nsweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the most prudent. She\\ngave the girdle to Juno and said, \"Take this girdle wherein all my\\ncharms reside and lay it in your bosom. If you will wear it I promise\\nyou that your errand, be it what it may, will not be bootless.\"\\n\\nWhen she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the girdle\\nin her bosom.\\n\\nVenus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted down from\\nthe summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair Emathia, and\\nwent on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of the Thracian\\nhorsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without ever setting foot\\nto ground. When she came to Athos she went on over the waves of the sea\\ntill she reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas. There she met Sleep,\\nown brother to Death, and caught him by the hand, saying, \"Sleep, you\\nwho lord it alike over mortals and immortals, if you ever did me a\\nservice in times past, do one for me now, and I shall be grateful to\\nyou ever after. Close Jove\\'s keen eyes for me in slumber while I hold\\nhim clasped in my embrace, and I will give you a beautiful golden seat,\\nthat can never fall to pieces; my clubfooted son Vulcan shall make it\\nfor you, and he shall give it a footstool for you to rest your fair\\nfeet upon when you are at table.\"\\n\\nThen Sleep answered, \"Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of\\nmighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep without\\ncompunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all of\\nthem proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleep unless\\nhe bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing what you asked\\nme, on the day when Jove\\'s mighty son Hercules set sail from Ilius\\nafter having sacked the city of the Trojans. At your bidding I suffused\\nmy sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and laid him to\\nrest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and set the blasts\\nof the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took him to the\\ngoodly city of Cos, away from all his friends. Jove was furious when he\\nawoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the house; he was\\nlooking more particularly for myself, and would have flung me down\\nthrough space into the sea where I should never have been heard of any\\nmore, had not Night who cows both men and gods protected me. I fled to\\nher and Jove left off looking for me in spite of his being so angry,\\nfor he did not dare do anything to displease Night. And now you are\\nagain asking me to do something on which I cannot venture.\"\\n\\nAnd Juno said, \"Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into your\\nhead? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans, as he\\nwas about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of the youngest of\\nthe Graces, and she shall be your own--Pasithea, whom you have always\\nwanted to marry.\"\\n\\nSleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, \"Then swear it to\\nme by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on the bounteous\\nearth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that all the gods who\\ndwell down below with Saturn may be our witnesses, and see that you\\nreally do give me one of the youngest of the Graces--Pasithea, whom I\\nhave always wanted to marry.\"\\n\\nJuno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of the\\nnether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she had completed\\nher oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist and sped\\nlightly forward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them. Presently they\\nreached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and Lectum where\\nthey left the sea to go on by land, and the tops of the trees of the\\nforest soughed under the going of their feet. Here Sleep halted, and\\nere Jove caught sight of him he climbed a lofty pine-tree--the tallest\\nthat reared its head towards heaven on all Ida. He hid himself behind\\nthe branches and sat there in the semblance of the sweet-singing bird\\nthat haunts the mountains and is called Chalcis by the gods, but men\\ncall it Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, the topmost peak of Ida,\\nand Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon her. As soon as he did so\\nhe became inflamed with the same passionate desire for her that he had\\nfelt when they had first enjoyed each other\\'s embraces, and slept with\\none another without their dear parents knowing anything about it. He\\nwent up to her and said, \"What do you want that you have come hither\\nfrom Olympus--and that too with neither chariot nor horses to convey\\nyou?\"\\n\\nThen Juno told him a lying tale and said, \"I am going to the world\\'s\\nend, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and mother\\nTethys; they received me into their house, took care of me, and brought\\nme up. I must go and see them that I may make peace between them: they\\nhave been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not slept with\\none another this long time. The horses that will take me over land and\\nsea are stationed on the lowermost spurs of many-fountained Ida, and I\\nhave come here from Olympus on purpose to consult you. I was afraid you\\nmight be angry with me later on, if I went to the house of Oceanus\\nwithout letting you know.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove said, \"Juno, you can choose some other time for paying your\\nvisit to Oceanus--for the present let us devote ourselves to love and\\nto the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been so overpowered\\nby passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am at this moment\\nfor yourself--not even when I was in love with the wife of Ixion who\\nbore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with Danae the\\ndaintily-ancled daughter of Acrisius, who bore me the famed hero\\nPerseus. Then there was the daughter of Phoenix, who bore me Minos and\\nRhadamanthus: there was Semele, and Alcmena in Thebes by whom I begot\\nmy lion-hearted son Hercules, while Semele became mother to Bacchus the\\ncomforter of mankind. There was queen Ceres again, and lovely Leto, and\\nyourself--but with none of these was I ever so much enamoured as I now\\nam with you.\"\\n\\nJuno again answered him with a lying tale. \"Most dread son of Saturn,\"\\nshe exclaimed, \"what are you talking about? Would you have us enjoy one\\nanother here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything can be seen?\\nWhat if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleeping together,\\nand tell the others? It would be such a scandal that when I had risen\\nfrom your embraces I could never show myself inside your house again;\\nbut if you are so minded, there is a room which your son Vulcan has\\nmade me, and he has given it good strong doors; if you would so have\\nit, let us go thither and lie down.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"Juno, you need not be afraid that either god or man\\nwill see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a dense golden\\ncloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams shall not\\nsee through it.\"\\n\\nWith this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace; whereon the\\nearth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with dew-bespangled\\nlotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that it raised them well\\nabove the ground. Here they laid themselves down and overhead they were\\ncovered by a fair cloud of gold, from which there fell glittering\\ndew-drops.\\n\\nThus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the crest\\nof Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his spouse in\\nhis arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the Achaeans, to\\ntell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the earthquake. When he had\\nfound him he said, \"Now, Neptune, you can help the Danaans with a will,\\nand give them victory though it be only for a short time while Jove is\\nstill sleeping. I have sent him into a sweet slumber, and Juno has\\nbeguiled him into going to bed with her.\"\\n\\nSleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind, leaving\\nNeptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He darted forward\\namong the first ranks and shouted saying, \"Argives, shall we let Hector\\nson of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships and covering himself\\nwith glory? This is what he says that he shall now do, seeing that\\nAchilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; we shall get on very well\\nwithout him if we keep each other in heart and stand by one another.\\nNow, therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us each take the best and\\nlargest shield we can lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally forth\\nwith our longest spears in our hands; I will lead you on, and Hector\\nson of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold out against us. If\\nany good staunch soldier has only a small shield, let him hand it over\\nto a worse man, and take a larger one for himself.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of Tydeus,\\nUlysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the others in\\narray, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges of armour; the\\nmost valiant took the best armour, and gave the worse to the worse man.\\nWhen they had donned their bronze armour they marched on with Neptune\\nat their head. In his strong hand he grasped his terrible sword, keen\\nof edge and flashing like lightning; woe to him who comes across it in\\nthe day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away from it.\\n\\nHector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptune and\\nHector waged fierce war on one another--Hector on the Trojan and\\nNeptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forces\\nmet; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and tents of the\\nAchaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly when driven\\nbefore the blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forest fire roar\\nmore fiercely when it is well alight upon the mountains, nor does the\\nwind bellow with ruder music as it tears on through the tops of when it\\nis blowing its hardest, than the terrible shout which the Trojans and\\nAchaeans raised as they sprang upon one another.\\n\\nHector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards him,\\nnor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two bands passed\\nover his chest--the band of his shield and that of his silver-studded\\nsword--and these protected his body. Hector was angry that his spear\\nshould have been hurled in vain, and withdrew under cover of his men.\\nAs he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamon, struck him with a\\nstone, of which there were many lying about under the men\\'s feet as\\nthey fought--brought there to give support to the ships\\' sides as they\\nlay on the shore. Ajax caught up one of them and struck Hector above\\nthe rim of his shield close to his neck; the blow made him spin round\\nlike a top and reel in all directions. As an oak falls headlong when\\nuprooted by the lightning flash of father Jove, and there is a terrible\\nsmell of brimstone--no man can help being dismayed if he is standing\\nnear it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing--even so did Hector\\nfall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell from his hand, but his\\nshield and helmet were made fast about his body, and his bronze armour\\nrang about him.\\n\\nThe sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him,\\nhoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans,\\nbut none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and covered\\nby the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captain of the\\nLycians, and noble Glaucus. Of the others, too, there was not one who\\nwas unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over him to\\ncover him. His comrades then lifted him off the ground and bore him\\naway from the battle to the place where his horses stood waiting for\\nhim at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot; these\\nthen took him towards the city groaning and in great pain. When they\\nreached the ford of the fair stream of Xanthus, begotten of Immortal\\nJove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on the\\nground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathed\\nagain and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomited blood,\\nbut soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were again closed in\\ndarkness for he was still stunned by the blow.\\n\\nWhen the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart and set\\nupon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of Oileus began by\\nspringing on Satnius son of Enops, and wounding him with his spear: a\\nfair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as he was herding cattle by the\\nbanks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus came up to him and\\nstruck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce fight between\\nTrojans and Danaans raged round his body. Polydamas son of Panthous\\ndrew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor son of Areilycus on the\\nright shoulder; the terrible spear went right through his shoulder, and\\nhe clutched the earth as he fell in the dust. Polydamas vaunted loudly\\nover him saying, \"Again I take it that the spear has not sped in vain\\nfrom the strong hand of the son of Panthous; an Argive has caught it in\\nhis body, and it will serve him for a staff as he goes down into the\\nhouse of Hades.\"\\n\\nThe Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon was\\nmore angry than any, for the man had fallen close beside him; so he\\naimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself by\\nswerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, for\\nheaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where the head springs\\nfrom the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severed both the\\ntendons at the back of the head. His head, mouth, and nostrils reached\\nthe ground long before his legs and knees could do so, and Ajax shouted\\nto Polydamas saying, \"Think, Polydamas, and tell me truly whether this\\nman is not as well worth killing as Prothoenor was: he seems rich, and\\nof rich family, a brother, it may be, or son of the knight Antenor, for\\nhe is very like him.\"\\n\\nBut he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered.\\nAcamas then bestrode his brother\\'s body and wounded Promachus the\\nBoeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother\\'s body\\naway. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying, \"Argive archers, braggarts\\nthat you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only, but some of\\nyou too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See how Promachus now\\nsleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother\\'s blood has not\\nbeen long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he leaves\\na kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall.\"\\n\\nHis taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged than\\nany of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not stand his\\nground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-master Phorbas,\\nwhom Mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealth than any\\nother of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleos now\\nwounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball from\\nits socket: the spear went right through the eye into the nape of the\\nneck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him. Peneleos then\\ndrew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and helmet\\ncame tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking in the\\neye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a poppy-head, and\\nshowed it to the Trojans, vaunting over them as he did so. \"Trojans,\"\\nhe cried, \"bid the father and mother of noble Ilioneus make moan for\\nhim in their house, for the wife also of Promachus son of Alegenor will\\nnever be gladdened by the coming of her dear husband--when we Argives\\nreturn with our ships from Troy.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about to\\nsee whither he might fly for safety.\\n\\nTell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of the\\nArgives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord of the\\nearthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was first\\nto wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians.\\nAntilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew Morys and\\nHippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The son of\\nAtreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in the flank, and\\nthe bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among them;\\non this his life came hurrying out of him at the place where he had\\nbeen wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son of Oileus\\nkilled more than any other, for there was no man so fleet as he to\\npursue flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.',\n",
       " 'Book XV\\n\\nMINERVA SUMMONS TELEMACHUS FROM LACEDAEMON--HE MEETS WITH THEOCLYMENUS\\nAT PYLOS AND BRINGS HIM TO ITHACA--ON LANDING HE GOES TO THE HUT OF\\nEUMAEUS.\\n\\nBut Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses\\' son\\nthat he was to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping\\nin the forecourt of Menelaus\\'s house; Pisistratus was fast asleep,\\nbut Telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy\\nfather, so Minerva went close up to him and said:\\n\\n\"Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer, nor\\nleave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they\\nwill eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a\\nfool\\'s errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if you wish to\\nfind your excellent mother still there when you get back. Her father and\\nbrothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus, who has given her\\nmore than any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his wedding\\npresents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the house in\\nspite of you, but you know what women are--they always want to do the\\nbest they can for the man who marries them, and never give another\\nthought to the children of their first husband, nor to their father\\neither when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and put\\neverything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you\\nhave, until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let\\nme tell you also of another matter which you had better attend to. The\\nchief men among the suitors are lying in wait for you in the Strait\\n{128} between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean to kill you before you\\ncan reach home. I do not much think they will succeed; it is more likely\\nthat some of those who are now eating up your property will find a grave\\nthemselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship well away from the\\nislands; the god who watches over you and protects you will send you a\\nfair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on to the\\ntown, but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge of your\\npigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the\\nnight, and then send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back\\nsafe from Pylos.\"\\n\\nThen she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus with\\nhis heel to rouse him, and said, \"Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the\\nhorses to the chariot, for we must set off home.\" {129}\\n\\nBut Pisistratus said, \"No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive\\nin the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought his\\npresents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good bye to\\nus in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest should never forget a\\nhost who has shown him kindness.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen,\\nleaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he\\nput on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his\\nshoulders, and went out to meet him. \"Menelaus,\" said he, \"let me go\\nback now to my own country, for I want to get home.\"\\n\\nAnd Menelaus answered, \"Telemachus, if you insist on going I will not\\ndetain you. I do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or\\ntoo rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a\\nman go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would\\nlike to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in the\\nhouse and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, till I\\ncan get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till you have\\nyourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient dinner\\nfor you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once more\\nproper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out on\\nsuch a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a tour\\nin Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and will conduct\\nyou myself through all our principal cities. No one will send us away\\nempty handed; every one will give us something--a bronze tripod, a\\ncouple of mules, or a gold cup.\"\\n\\n\"Menelaus,\" replied Telemachus, \"I want to go home at once, for when\\nI came away I left my property without protection, and fear that\\nwhile looking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that\\nsomething valuable has been stolen during my absence.\"\\n\\nWhen Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to\\nprepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At\\nthis moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got\\nup; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook some meat, which he\\nat once did. Then Menelaus went down into his fragrant store room, {130}\\nnot alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached the\\nplace where the treasures of his house were kept, he selected a double\\ncup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also a silver mixing bowl.\\nMeanwhile Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely dresses\\nwhich she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was largest\\nand most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a star,\\nand lay at the very bottom of the chest. {131} Then they all came back\\nthrough the house again till they got to Telemachus, and Menelaus said,\\n\"Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring you safely home\\naccording to your desire. I will now present you with the finest and\\nmost precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing bowl of\\npure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold, and it is the\\nwork of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians made me a present of it\\nin the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on my return home.\\nI should like to give it to you.\"\\n\\nWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,\\nwhile Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before\\nhim. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.\\n\\n\"I too, my son,\" said she, \"have something for you as a keepsake from\\nthe hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day.\\nTill then, get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go back\\nrejoicing to your own country and to your home.\"\\n\\nSo saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. Then\\nPisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them all as\\nhe did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus into the\\nhouse, and they both of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought\\nthem water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin\\nfor them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them;\\nan upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of\\nwhat there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and gave them each\\ntheir portions, while Megapenthes poured out the wine. Then they laid\\ntheir hands upon the good things that were before them, but as soon as\\nthey had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked\\nthe horses, and took their places in the chariot. They drove out through\\nthe inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court,\\nand Menelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right\\nhand that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood\\nin front of the horses and pledged them, saying, \"Farewell to both of\\nyou; see that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as\\nkind to me as any father could be while we Achaeans were fighting before\\nTroy.\"\\n\\n\"We will be sure, sir,\" answered Telemachus, \"to tell him everything as\\nsoon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses returned\\nwhen I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very great\\nkindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents I am\\ntaking with me.\"\\n\\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand--an eagle with a\\ngreat white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm\\nyard--and all the men and women were running after it and shouting. It\\ncame quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands in front\\nof the horses. When they saw it they were glad, and their hearts took\\ncomfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said, \"Tell me, Menelaus, has\\nheaven sent this omen for us or for you?\"\\n\\nMenelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to\\nmake, but Helen was too quick for him and said, \"I will read this matter\\nas heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it will come\\nto pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred and has\\nits nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having travelled far and\\nsuffered much, will return to take his revenge--if indeed he is not back\\nalready and hatching mischief for the suitors.\"\\n\\n\"May Jove so grant it,\" replied Telemachus, \"if it should prove to be\\nso, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I am at\\nhome.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed\\nthrough the town towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon\\ntheir necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and\\ndarkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles\\nlived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus. There they passed\\nthe night and were treated hospitably. When the child of morning,\\nrosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and their\\nplaces in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and\\nunder the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed\\nhis horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came to\\nPylos, and then Telemachus said:\\n\\n\"Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you.\\nYou know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are both\\nof an age, and this journey has brought us together still more closely;\\ndo not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I go\\nto your father\\'s house he will try to keep me in the warmth of his good\\nwill towards me, and I must go home at once.\"\\n\\nPisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end he\\ndeemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus\\'s\\nbeautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then\\nhe said, \"Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also before\\nI can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he is, and am\\nsure he will not let you go; he will come down here to fetch you, and he\\nwill not go back without you. But he will be very angry.\"\\n\\nWith this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians and\\nsoon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together and gave\\nhis orders. \"Now, my men,\" said he, \"get everything in order on board\\nthe ship, and let us set out home.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as\\nTelemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva\\nin the ship\\'s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country,\\na seer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was\\ndescended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep;\\nhe was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile by the\\ngreat and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held them\\nfor a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the house\\nof king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on account of the\\ndaughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow that\\ndread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped with his\\nlife, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged the wrong that had\\nbeen done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to his brother. Then he\\nleft the country and went to Argos, where it was ordained that he should\\nreign over much people. There he married, established himself, and had\\ntwo famous sons Antiphates and Mantius. Antiphates became father of\\nOicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by Jove\\nand by Apollo, but he did not live to old age, for he was killed\\nin Thebes by reason of a woman\\'s gifts. His sons were Alcmaeon\\nand Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was father to\\nPolypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off Cleitus\\nfor his beauty\\'s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals, but\\nApollo made Polypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now that\\nAmphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with his father and went to live in\\nHyperesia, where he remained and prophesied for all men.\\n\\nHis son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he was\\nmaking drink-offerings and praying in his ship. \"Friend,\" said he,\\n\"now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your\\nsacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them, I pray you\\nalso by your own head and by those of your followers tell me the truth\\nand nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me also of your\\ntown and parents.\"\\n\\nTelemachus said, \"I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and\\nmy father is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come\\nto some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew\\ntogether to see if I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a\\nlong time.\"\\n\\n\"I too,\" answered Theoclymenus, \"am an exile, for I have killed a man\\nof my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they\\nhave great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at their\\nhands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the earth. I\\nam your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship that they may\\nnot kill me, for I know they are in pursuit.\"\\n\\n\"I will not refuse you,\" replied Telemachus, \"if you wish to join us.\\nCome, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according to\\nwhat we have.\"\\n\\nOn this he received Theoclymenus\\' spear and laid it down on the deck of\\nthe ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoclymenus\\nsit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemachus told them to\\ncatch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. They set the\\nmast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made it fast with\\nthe forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with sheets of twisted\\nox hide. Minerva sent them a fair wind that blew fresh and strong to\\ntake the ship on her course as fast as possible. Thus then they passed\\nby Crouni and Chalcis.\\n\\nPresently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel\\nmade a quick passage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where the Epeans\\nrule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands, {132} wondering\\nwithin himself whether he should escape death or should be taken\\nprisoner.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the hut,\\nand the men supped with them. As soon as they had had to eat and drink,\\nUlysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether he would\\ncontinue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the station or\\npack him off to the city; so he said:\\n\\n\"Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin begging\\nabout the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men. Give\\nme your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go with me\\nand show me the way. I will go the round of the city begging as I needs\\nmust, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I\\nshould like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring news of her\\nhusband to Queen Penelope. I could then go about among the suitors and\\nsee if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should\\nsoon make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and\\nbelieve when I tell you that by the blessing of Mercury who gives grace\\nand good name to the works of all men, there is no one living who would\\nmake a more handy servant than I should--to put fresh wood on the fire,\\nchop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and do all those services that\\npoor men have to do for their betters.\"\\n\\nThe swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. \"Heaven help\\nme,\" he exclaimed, \"what ever can have put such a notion as that into\\nyour head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone to a certainty,\\nfor their pride and insolence reach the very heavens. They would never\\nthink of taking a man like you for a servant. Their servants are all\\nyoung men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and shirts, with well\\nlooking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables are kept quite\\nclean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay where you are,\\nthen; you are not in anybody\\'s way; I do not mind your being here, no\\nmore do any of the others, and when Telemachus comes home he will give\\nyou a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you want to go.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are to\\nme, for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble; there\\nis nothing worse than being always on the tramp; still, when men have\\nonce got low down in the world they will go through a great deal on\\nbehalf of their miserable bellies. Since, however, you press me to stay\\nhere and await the return of Telemachus, tell me about Ulysses\\' mother,\\nand his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he set\\nout for Troy. Are they still living or are they already dead and in the\\nhouse of Hades?\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you all about them,\" replied Eumaeus, \"Laertes is still\\nliving and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully in his own house,\\nfor he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also\\nabout the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him more\\nthan anything else did. She came to an unhappy end {133} through sorrow\\nfor her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me come\\nto such an end as she did. As long as she was still living, though she\\nwas always grieving, I used to like seeing her and asking her how she\\ndid, for she brought me up along with her daughter Ctimene, the youngest\\nof her children; we were boy and girl together, and she made little\\ndifference between us. When, however, we both grew up, they sent Ctimene\\nto Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As for me, my mistress\\ngave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for my feet, and\\nsent me off into the country, but she was just as fond of me as ever.\\nThis is all over now. Still it has pleased heaven to prosper my work in\\nthe situation which I now hold. I have enough to eat and drink, and can\\nfind something for any respectable stranger who comes here; but there\\nis no getting a kind word or deed out of my mistress, for the house has\\nfallen into the hands of wicked people. Servants want sometimes to see\\ntheir mistress and have a talk with her; they like to have something\\nto eat and drink at the house, and something too to take back with them\\ninto the country. This is what will keep servants in a good humour.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Then you must have been a very little fellow,\\nEumaeus, when you were taken so far away from your home and parents.\\nTell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother\\nlived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you\\nwere alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for\\nwhatever your master gave them?\"\\n\\n\"Stranger,\" replied Eumaeus, \"as regards your question: sit still, make\\nyourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. The nights\\nare now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and\\nsitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed till bed time,\\ntoo much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one of the others wishes\\nto go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can then take my master\\'s\\npigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning. We too will sit here\\neating and drinking in the hut, and telling one another stories about\\nour misfortunes; for when a man has suffered much, and been buffeted\\nabout in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling the memory of sorrows\\nthat have long gone by. As regards your question, then, my tale is as\\nfollows:\\n\\n\"You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above\\nOrtygia, {134} where the land begins to turn round and look in another\\ndirection. {135} It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good,\\nwith much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine\\nand wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by any\\nsickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them\\nwith his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole\\ncountry is divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus,\\na man comparable to the gods, reigned over both.\\n\\n\"Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for\\nthe Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted\\nwith gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in\\nmy father\\'s house, very tall and comely, and an excellent servant; these\\nscoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing near their ship,\\nseduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman can resist, no matter\\nhow good she may be by nature. The man who had seduced her asked her who\\nshe was and where she came from, and on this she told him her father\\'s\\nname. \\'I come from Sidon,\\' said she, \\'and am daughter to Arybas, a\\nman rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming into the town from the\\ncountry, some Taphian pirates seized me and took me here over the sea,\\nwhere they sold me to the man who owns this house, and he gave them\\ntheir price for me.\\'\\n\\n\"The man who had seduced her then said, \\'Would you like to come along\\nwith us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves?\\nThey are both alive and are said to be well off.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'I will do so gladly,\\' answered she, \\'if you men will first swear me a\\nsolemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.\\'\\n\\n\"They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their oath\\nthe woman said, \\'Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the street or\\nat the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one should go and\\ntell my master, in which case he would suspect something. He would put\\nme in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep your own counsel\\ntherefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can, and send me word\\nwhen you have done loading. I will bring as much gold as I can lay my\\nhands on, and there is something else also that I can do towards paying\\nmy fare. I am nurse to the son of the good man of the house, a funny\\nlittle fellow just able to run about. I will carry him off in your ship,\\nand you will get a great deal of money for him if you take him and sell\\nhim in foreign parts.\\'\\n\\n\"On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole\\nyear till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,\\nand then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the\\nwoman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father\\'s house\\nbringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it; and\\nwhile my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring it and\\nbargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and then went\\nback to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of the\\nhouse. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with\\nthe cups of guests who had been feasting with my father, as being in\\nattendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public\\nassembly, so she snatched up three cups and carried them off in the\\nbosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew no better. The sun\\nwas now set, and darkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as\\nfast as we could till we reached the harbour, where the Phoenician ship\\nwas lying. When they had got on board they sailed their ways over the\\nsea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did\\nwe sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck the\\nwoman and she fell heavily down into the ship\\'s hold as though she were\\na sea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the\\nseals and fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the\\nwinds and waves took the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of\\nhis chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon\\nthis country.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes\\nwith the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good as\\nwell as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master, who\\nsees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a good\\nlife, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city to city.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left for\\nsleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the mean time Telemachus and his\\ncrew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the mast,\\nand rowed the ship into the harbour. {136} They cast out their mooring\\nstones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore,\\nmixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough\\nto eat and drink Telemachus said, \"Take the ship on to the town, but\\nleave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms.\\nIn the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to the\\ncity, and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give you\\nall a good dinner with meat and wine.\" {137}\\n\\nThen Theoclymenus said, \"And what, my dear young friend, is to become of\\nme? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? or shall I\\ngo straight to your own house and to your mother?\"\\n\\n\"At any other time,\" replied Telemachus, \"I should have bidden you go to\\nmy own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at the present\\nmoment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for I shall be\\naway, and my mother will not see you; she does not often show herself\\neven to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an upper chamber,\\nout of their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can go\\nto--I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is held in the highest\\nestimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and the most\\npersistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother and\\ntrying to take Ulysses\\' place. Jove, however, in heaven alone knows\\nwhether or no they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes\\nplace.\"\\n\\nAs he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand--a hawk, Apollo\\'s\\nmessenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore\\nthem off, {138} fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the\\nship. On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.\\n\"Telemachus,\" said he, \"that bird did not fly on your right hand without\\nhaving been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew it was an\\nomen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there will be no\\nhouse in Ithaca more royal than your own.\"\\n\\n\"I wish it may prove so,\" answered Telemachus. \"If it does, I will show\\nyou so much good will and give you so many presents that all who meet\\nyou will congratulate you.\"\\n\\nThen he said to his friend Piraeus, \"Piraeus, son of Clytius, you have\\nthroughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all those who\\nhave accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this stranger to\\nyour own house and entertain him hospitably till I can come for him.\"\\n\\nAnd Piraeus answered, \"Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you\\nplease, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack of\\nhospitality.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and loose\\nthe hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. But Telemachus\\nbound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head\\nof sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the\\nhawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city\\nas they had been told to do, while Telemachus strode on as fast as he\\ncould, till he reached the homestead where his countless herds of\\nswine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who was so\\ndevoted a servant to his master.']"

       "['BOOK XX\\n\\n  The gods hold a council and determine to watch the fight, from\\n  the hill Callicolone, and the barrow of Hercules--A fight\\n  between Achilles and AEneas is interrupted by Neptune, who\\n  saves AEneas--Achilles kills many Trojans.\\n\\nTHUS, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son of\\nPeleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over against\\nthem armed upon the rise of the plain.\\n\\nMeanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis gather\\nthe gods in council, whereon she went about and called them to the\\nhouse of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nor a\\nsingle one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of rivers\\nand meadows of green grass. When they reached the house of\\ncloud-compelling Jove, they took their seats in the arcades of polished\\nmarble which Vulcan with his consummate skill had made for father Jove.\\n\\nIn such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove. Neptune\\nalso, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the goddess, and came\\nup out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in the midst of them, he\\nasked what Jove\\'s purpose might be. \"Why,\" said he, \"wielder of the\\nlightning, have you called the gods in council? Are you considering\\nsome matter that concerns the Trojans and Achaeans--for the blaze of\\nbattle is on the point of being kindled between them?\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and wherefore\\nI have called you hither. I take thought for them even in their\\ndestruction. For my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt. Olympus\\nand look on in peace, but do you others go about among Trojans and\\nAchaeans, and help either side as you may be severally disposed. If\\nAchilles fights the Trojans without hindrance they will make no stand\\nagainst him; they have ever trembled at the sight of him, and now that\\nhe is roused to such fury about his comrade, he will override fate\\nitself and storm their city.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took their\\nseveral sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva,\\nearth-encircling Neptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellent in\\nall cunning--all these joined the host that came from the ships; with\\nthem also came Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with his thin\\nlegs plying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined the\\nTrojans, and with him Apollo of locks unshorn, and the archer goddess\\nDiana, Leto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus.\\n\\nSo long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the\\nAchaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fight\\nwas now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him for\\nfear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his armour,\\nand looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympians came to\\ntake their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife, rouser of\\nhosts, and Minerva raised her loud voice, now standing by the deep\\ntrench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with all her might\\nupon the shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed out upon the\\nother side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called on the Trojans\\nat the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and now speeding up\\nthe side of the river Simois till he came to the hill Callicolone.\\n\\nThus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce\\ncontention also among themselves. The sire of gods and men thundered\\nfrom heaven above, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth, and\\nbade the high hills tremble. The spurs and crests of many-fountained\\nIda quaked, as also the city of the Trojans and the ships of the\\nAchaeans. Hades, king of the realms below, was struck with fear; he\\nsprang panic-stricken from his throne and cried aloud in terror lest\\nNeptune, lord of the earthquake, should crack the ground over his head,\\nand lay bare his mouldy mansions to the sight of mortals and\\nimmortals--mansions so ghastly grim that even the gods shudder to think\\nof them. Such was the uproar as the gods came together in battle.\\nApollo with his arrows took his stand to face King Neptune, while\\nMinerva took hers against the god of war; the archer-goddess Diana with\\nher golden arrows, sister of far-darting Apollo, stood to face Juno;\\nMercury the lusty bringer of good luck faced Leto, while the mighty\\neddying river whom men can Scamander, but gods Xanthus, matched himself\\nagainst Vulcan.\\n\\nThe gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the heart of\\nAchilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it was with his\\nblood that he longed above all things else to glut the stubborn lord of\\nbattle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attack the son of Peleus, and\\nput courage into his heart, speaking with the voice of Lycaon son of\\nPriam. In his likeness therefore, he said to Aeneas, \"Aeneas,\\ncounsellor of the Trojans, where are now the brave words with which you\\nvaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes, saying that you would\\nfight Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?\"\\n\\nAnd Aeneas answered, \"Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son of\\nPeleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, it would\\nnot be for the first time. His spear has already put me to flight from\\nIda, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus and Pedasus; Jove\\nindeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to fly, else had I\\nfallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, who went before him to\\nprotect him and urged him to fall upon the Lelegae and Trojans. No man\\nmay fight Achilles, for one of the gods is always with him as his\\nguardian angel, and even were it not so, his weapon flies ever\\nstraight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him who is against him;\\nif heaven would let me fight him on even terms he should not soon\\novercome me, though he boasts that he is made of bronze.\"\\n\\nThen said King Apollo, son to Jove, \"Nay, hero, pray to the ever-living\\ngods, for men say that you were born of Jove\\'s daughter Venus, whereas\\nAchilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus is child to Jove,\\nwhile Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea. Bring,\\ntherefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare you with\\nhis taunts and menaces.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his\\npeople, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremost\\nfighters. Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed\\nJuno, as he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She called the\\ngods about her, and said, \"Look to it, you two, Neptune and Minerva,\\nand consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas\\nclad in full armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turn him back at once,\\nor shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow him with strength so\\nthat his heart fail not, and he may learn that the chiefs of the\\nimmortals are on his side, while the others who have all along been\\ndefending the Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all come down from\\nOlympus and join in the fight, that this day he may take no hurt at the\\nhands of the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whatever fate may have\\nspun out for him when he was begotten and his mother bore him. If\\nAchilles be not thus assured by the voice of a god, he may come to fear\\npresently when one of us meets him in battle, for the gods are terrible\\nif they are seen face to face.\"\\n\\nNeptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, \"Juno, restrain\\nyour fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcing the other gods\\nto fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our own side; let us\\ntake our places on some hill out of the beaten track, and let mortals\\nfight it out among themselves. If Mars or Phoebus Apollo begin\\nfighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannot fight, we too,\\nwill at once raise the cry of battle, and in that case they will soon\\nleave the field and go back vanquished to Olympus among the other gods.\"\\n\\nWith these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high\\nearth-barrow of Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by the\\nTrojans and Pallas Minerva for him to fly to when the sea-monster was\\nchasing him from the shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and those that\\nwere with him took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud of darkness;\\nbut the other gods seated themselves on the brow of Callicolone round\\nyou, O Phoebus, and Mars the waster of cities.\\n\\nThus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side was\\nwilling to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seat on high\\nwas in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain was alive with\\nmen and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. The earth rang\\nagain under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards each other,\\nand two champions, by far the foremost of them all, met between the\\nhosts to fight--to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises, and noble Achilles.\\n\\nAeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet\\ntossing defiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before his\\nbreast, and brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from the\\nother side sprang forth to meet him, like some fierce lion that the\\nwhole country-side has met to hunt and kill--at first he bodes no ill,\\nbut when some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouches\\nopenmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tail from\\nside to side about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springs\\nstraight before him, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slain\\namong the foremost of his foes--even with such fury did Achilles burn\\nto spring upon Aeneas.\\n\\nWhen they were now close up with one another Achilles was first to\\nspeak. \"Aeneas,\" said he, \"why do you stand thus out before the host to\\nfight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the seat of\\nPriam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom over to\\nyou. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his own. Or\\nhave the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness, fair\\nwith orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? This you\\nshall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have you\\nforgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds\\nhelter-skelter down the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to look\\nbehind you; you took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the city, and\\nwith the help of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it and carried its\\nwomen into captivity, though Jove and the other gods rescued you. You\\nthink they will protect you now, but they will not do so; therefore I\\nsay go back into the host, and do not face me, or you will rue it. Even\\na fool may be wise after the event.\"\\n\\nThen Aeneas answered, \"Son of Peleus, think not that your words can\\nscare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can brag and talk\\nunseemly. We know one another\\'s race and parentage as matters of common\\nfame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor I yours. Men say\\nthat you are son to noble Peleus, and that your mother is Thetis,\\nfair-haired daughter of the sea. I have noble Anchises for my father,\\nand Venus for my mother; the parents of one or other of us shall this\\nday mourn a son, for it will be more than silly talk that shall part us\\nwhen the fight is over. Learn, then, my lineage if you will--and it is\\nknown to many.\\n\\n\"In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded Dardania,\\nfor Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men to dwell in, and\\nher people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained Ida. Dardanus\\nhad a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest of all men living; he\\nhad three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and their\\nfoals with them. Boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding, and\\ncovered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly\\nfoals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped over the\\nrich plain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of corn and not\\nbreak them; or again when they would disport themselves on the broad\\nback of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonius\\nbegat Tros, king of the Trojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilus,\\nAssaracus, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the\\ngods carried him off to be Jove\\'s cupbearer, for his beauty\\'s sake,\\nthat he might dwell among the immortals. Ilus begat Laomedon, and\\nLaomedon begat Tithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the\\nstock of Mars. But Assaracus was father to Capys, and Capys to\\nAnchises, who was my father, while Hector is son to Priam.\\n\\n\"Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove gives\\nit or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now let there be\\nno more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were children. We\\ncould fling taunts without end at one another; a hundred-oared galley\\nwould not hold them. The tongue can run all whithers and talk all wise;\\nit can go here and there, and as a man says, so shall he be gainsaid.\\nWhat is the use of our bandying hard like women who when they fall foul\\nof one another go out and wrangle in the streets, one half true and the\\nother lies, as rage inspires them? No words of yours shall turn me now\\nthat I am fain to fight--therefore let us make trial of one another\\nwith our spears.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield of\\nAchilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleus held\\nthe shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid, for he\\ndeemed that Aeneas\\'s spear would go through it quite easily, not\\nreflecting that the god\\'s glorious gifts were little likely to yield\\nbefore the blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas\\'s spear did not\\npierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the\\npoint. It went through two layers, but the god had made the shield in\\nfive, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, and one of gold; it\\nwas in this that the spear was stayed.\\n\\nAchilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas at\\nthe very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelian ash\\nwent clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas was\\nafraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him; the\\nspear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the ground,\\nafter having gone through both circles of the sheltering shield. Aeneas\\nthough he had avoided the spear, stood still, blinded with fear and\\ngrief because the weapon had gone so near him; then Achilles sprang\\nfuriously upon him, with a cry as of death and with his keen blade\\ndrawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that two men, as men\\nnow are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas wielded it quite easily.\\n\\nAeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards him,\\neither on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, and Achilles\\nwould have closed with him and despatched him with his sword, had not\\nNeptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said forthwith\\nto the immortals, \"Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, who will now go\\ndown to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son of Peleus. Fool that\\nhe was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo. Apollo will never save him\\nfrom destruction. Why should this man suffer when he is guiltless, to\\nno purpose, and in another\\'s quarrel? Has he not at all times offered\\nacceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in heaven? Let us then\\nsnatch him from death\\'s jaws, lest the son of Saturn be angry should\\nAchilles slay him. It is fated, moreover, that he should escape, and\\nthat the race of Dardanus, whom Jove loved above all the sons born to\\nhim of mortal women, shall not perish utterly without seed or sign. For\\nnow indeed has Jove hated the blood of Priam, while Aeneas shall reign\\nover the Trojans, he and his children\\'s children that shall be born\\nhereafter.\"\\n\\nThen answered Juno, \"Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, and\\nconsider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer him,\\nbrave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of Peleus. For\\nof a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn full many a time\\nbefore all the immortals, that never would we shield Trojans from\\ndestruction, not even when all Troy is burning in the flames that the\\nAchaeans shall kindle.\"\\n\\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle amid\\nthe clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles and Aeneas\\nwere. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son of\\nPeleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of Aeneas,\\nand laid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas on high from\\noff the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of many a band of\\nwarriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god\\'s hand sped him,\\ntill he came to the very fringe of the battle where the Cauconians were\\narming themselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of the earth, then came\\nnear to him and said, \"Aeneas, what god has egged you on to this folly\\nin fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a mightier man of valour and\\nmore beloved of heaven than you are? Give way before him whensoever you\\nmeet him, lest you go down to the house of Hades even though fate would\\nhave it otherwise. When Achilles is dead you may then fight among the\\nforemost undaunted, for none other of the Achaeans shall slay you.\"\\n\\nThe god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at once\\nremoved the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who opened them\\nwide indeed and said in great anger, \"Alas! what marvel am I now\\nbeholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not him whom I\\nmeant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also must be under\\nheaven\\'s protection, although I had thought his boasting was idle. Let\\nhim go hang; he will be in no mood to fight me further, seeing how\\nnarrowly he has missed being killed. I will now give my orders to the\\nDanaans and attack some other of the Trojans.\"\\n\\nHe sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did so.\\n\"Let not the Trojans,\" he cried, \"keep you at arm\\'s length, Achaeans,\\nbut go for them and fight them man for man. However valiant I may be, I\\ncannot give chase to so many and fight all of them. Even Mars, who is\\nan immortal, or Minerva, would shrink from flinging himself into the\\njaws of such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless, so far as in\\nme lies I will show no slackness of hand or foot nor want of endurance,\\nnot even for a moment; I will utterly break their ranks, and woe to the\\nTrojan who shall venture within reach of my spear.\"\\n\\nThus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans and\\ndeclared that he would fight Achilles. \"Be not afraid, proud Trojans,\"\\nsaid he, \"to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if the\\nbattle were one of words only, but they would be more than a match for\\nme, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deed of Achilles will fall\\nsomewhat short of his word; he will do in part, and the other part he\\nwill clip short. I will go up against him though his hands be as\\nfire--though his hands be fire and his strength iron.\"\\n\\nThus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the Achaeans, and\\nraised the cry of battle as they flung themselves into the midst of\\ntheir ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector and said, \"Hector, on\\nno account must you challenge Achilles to single combat; keep a lookout\\nfor him while you are under cover of the others and away from the thick\\nof the fight, otherwise he will either hit you with a spear or cut you\\ndown at close quarters.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was afraid\\nwhen he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then sprang upon\\nthe Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with a garment.\\nFirst he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of much people whom\\na naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities, in the land of\\nHyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achilles struck him full on\\nthe head as he was coming on towards him, and split it clean in two;\\nwhereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles vaunted over him\\nsaying, \"You be low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; your death is here,\\nbut your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your father\\'s estate\\nlies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters of Hermus.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The\\nchariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him in\\nthe front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, a\\nvaliant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple\\nthrough his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the spear,\\nbut it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain inside was\\nshed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended. Then he\\nstruck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down from his\\nchariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He breathed his last,\\nbellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him to offer\\nhim in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of the\\nearth-shaker is glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying. Achilles\\nthen went in pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his father had\\nalways forbidden to fight because he was the youngest of his sons, the\\none he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in his folly and showing\\noff the fleetness of his feet, was rushing about among front ranks\\nuntil he lost his life, for Achilles struck him in the middle of the\\nback as he was darting past him: he struck him just at the golden\\nfastenings of his belt and where the two pieces of the double\\nbreastplate overlapped. The point of the spear pierced him through and\\ncame out by the navel, whereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a\\ncloud of darkness overshadowed him as he sank holding his entrails in\\nhis hands.\\n\\nWhen Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his hands\\nand sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and he\\ncould not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised his\\nspear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. When Achilles\\nsaw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, \"This is he that has\\nwounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. Not for\\nlong shall we two quail before one another on the highways of war.\"\\n\\nHe looked fiercely on Hector and said, \"Draw near, that you may meet\\nyour doom the sooner.\" Hector feared him not and answered, \"Son of\\nPeleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a\\nchild; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you are\\na mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue lies\\nin the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may not slay you\\nwith my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now.\"\\n\\nHe hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, and\\nthough she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from going\\ntowards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet in\\nfront of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud cry,\\nbent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god can, and\\nhid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards him\\nspear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air. When he\\nrushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god, he shouted\\naloud saying, \"Hound, this time too you have escaped death--but of a\\ntruth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom it seems\\nyou pray before you go into battle, has again saved you; but if I too\\nhave any friend among the gods I will surely make an end of you when I\\ncome across you at some other time. Now, however, I will pursue and\\novertake other Trojans.\"\\n\\nOn this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his neck,\\nand he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and stayed\\nDemouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great stature, by\\nhitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him with his sword\\nand killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus and Dardanus, sons of\\nBias, and threw them from their chariot, the one with a blow from a\\nthrown spear, while the other he cut down in hand-to-hand fight. There\\nwas also Tros the son of Alastor--he came up to Achilles and clasped\\nhis knees in the hope that he would spare him and not kill him but let\\nhim go, because they were both of the same age. Fool, he might have\\nknown that he should not prevail with him, for the man was in no mood\\nfor pity or forbearance but was in grim earnest. Therefore when Tros\\nlaid hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers, Achilles\\ndrove his sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling out, while\\nhis bosom was all covered with the black blood that welled from the\\nwound. Thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless.\\n\\nAchilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with a spear,\\nand the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. He also\\nstruck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which became\\nwarm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes of\\nEcheclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded Deucalion\\nin the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon he\\nwaited Achilles\\' onset with his arm hanging down and death staring him\\nin the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blow from his sword and\\nflung it helmet and all away from him, and the marrow came oozing out\\nof his backbone as he lay. He then went in pursuit of Rhigmus, noble\\nson of Peires, who had come from fertile Thrace, and struck him through\\nthe middle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly, so that he\\nfell headlong from his chariot. He also speared Areithous squire to\\nRhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses in flight, and thrust\\nhim from his chariot, while the horses were struck with panic.\\n\\nAs a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought--and the\\ndense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues of\\nfire in every direction--even so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding\\nhis spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom he\\nwould slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokes\\nbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor--and\\nit is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle--even so\\ndid the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies of the\\nslain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the car were\\nbespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses\\' hoofs, and\\nfrom the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on to win\\nstill further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.',\n",
       " 'Book XIX\\n\\nTELEMACHUS AND ULYSSES REMOVE THE ARMOUR--ULYSSES INTERVIEWS\\nPENELOPE--EURYCLEA WASHES HIS FEET AND RECOGNISES THE SCAR ON HIS\\nLEG--PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.\\n\\nUlysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby with\\nMinerva\\'s help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he said\\nto Telemachus, \"Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take\\nit down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have\\nremoved it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the\\nsmoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went\\naway, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more\\nparticularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over\\ntheir wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace\\nboth banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people\\nto use them.\"\\n\\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse\\nEuryclea and said, \"Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I take\\nthe armour that my father left behind him down into the store room. No\\none looks after it now my father is gone, and it has got all smirched\\nwith soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it down where the smoke\\ncannot reach it.\"\\n\\n\"I wish, child,\" answered Euryclea, \"that you would take the management\\nof the house into your own hands altogether, and look after all the\\nproperty yourself. But who is to go with you and light you to the\\nstore-room? The maids would have done so, but you would not let them.\"\\n\\n\"The stranger,\" said Telemachus, \"shall show me a light; when people eat\\nmy bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.\"\\n\\nEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room.\\nThen Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields,\\nand spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her\\nhand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said,\\n\"Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the rafters,\\ncrossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow as with\\na flaming fire. Surely there is some god here who has come down from\\nheaven.\"\\n\\n\"Hush,\" answered Ulysses, \"hold your peace and ask no questions, for\\nthis is the manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here\\nto talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will\\nask me all sorts of questions.\"\\n\\nOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner\\ncourt, to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed\\ntill morning, while Ulysses was left in the cloister pondering on the\\nmeans whereby with Minerva\\'s help he might be able to kill the suitors.\\n\\nThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, and\\nthey set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the\\nfire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a\\nfootstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was covered with\\na thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came from the women\\'s\\nroom to join her. They set about removing the tables at which the wicked\\nsuitors had been dining, and took away the bread that was left, with\\nthe cups from which they had drunk. They emptied the embers out of the\\nbraziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give both light and heat;\\nbut Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a second time and said, \"Stranger,\\ndo you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all night and spying\\nupon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat your supper there,\\nor you shall be driven out with a firebrand.\"\\n\\nUlysses scowled at her and answered, \"My good woman, why should you be\\nso angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all\\nin rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner\\nof tramps and beggars generally? I too was a rich man once, and had a\\nfine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now\\nam, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of\\nservants, and all the other things which people have who live well and\\nare accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from me;\\ntherefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that pride and place\\nin which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you get\\nout of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come home, for\\nthere is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be dead\\nas you think he is, yet by Apollo\\'s will he has left a son behind him,\\nTelemachus, who will note anything done amiss by the maids in the house,\\nfor he is now no longer in his boyhood.\"\\n\\nPenelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, \"Impudent\\nbaggage,\" said she, \"I see how abominably you are behaving, and you\\nshall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself, that\\nI was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband, for whose\\nsake I am in such continual sorrow.\"\\n\\nThen she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, \"Bring a seat with a\\nfleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his story,\\nand listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions.\"\\n\\nEurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as soon\\nas Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, \"Stranger, I shall\\nfirst ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and parents.\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" answered Ulysses, \"who on the face of the whole earth can dare\\nto chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven itself; you\\nare like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness, as the monarch\\nover a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat and barley,\\nthe trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring forth lambs, and the sea\\nabounds with fish by reason of his virtues, and his people do good deeds\\nunder him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in your house, ask me some other\\nquestion and do not seek to know my race and family, or you will recall\\nmemories that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am full of heaviness,\\nbut I ought not to sit weeping and wailing in another person\\'s house,\\nnor is it well to be thus grieving continually. I shall have one of the\\nservants or even yourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes\\nswim with tears because I am heavy with wine.\"\\n\\nThen Penelope answered, \"Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,\\nwhether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my\\ndear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs\\nI should be both more respected and should show a better presence to\\nthe world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\\nwhich heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our\\nislands--Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself,\\nare wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore\\nshow no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say\\nthat they are skilled artisans, but am all the time broken-hearted\\nabout Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to invent\\nstratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven put it in\\nmy mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to begin\\nworking upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to them,\\n\\'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry\\nagain immediately; wait--for I would not have my skill in needlework\\nperish unrecorded--till I have finished making a pall for the hero\\nLaertes, to be ready against the time when death shall take him. He\\nis very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out\\nwithout a pall.\\' This was what I said, and they assented; whereon I\\nused to keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would\\nunpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for\\nthree years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I was\\nnow in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been\\naccomplished, those good for nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the\\nsuitors, who broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with\\nme, so I was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now\\nI do not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of this\\nmarriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son\\nchafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for he is\\nnow old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to look\\nafter his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an excellent\\ndisposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you are and\\nwhere you come from--for you must have had father and mother of some\\nsort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in\\nasking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs me:\\npeople must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long as\\nI have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as\\nregards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair and\\nfruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and\\nthere are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different languages\\nwhich overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans,\\nDorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great\\ntown there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every nine years had a\\nconference with Jove himself. {152} Minos was father to Deucalion, whose\\nson I am, for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus\\nsailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called Aethon; my\\nbrother, however, was at once the older and the more valiant of the two;\\nhence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him hospitality, for\\nthe winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy, carrying him out\\nof his course from cape Malea and leaving him in Amnisus off the cave of\\nIlithuia, where the harbours are difficult to enter and he could hardly\\nfind shelter from the winds that were then raging. As soon as he got\\nthere he went into the town and asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his\\nold and valued friend, but Idomeneus had already set sail for Troy some\\nten or twelve days earlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him\\nevery kind of hospitality, for I had abundance of everything. Moreover,\\nI fed the men who were with him with barley meal from the public store,\\nand got subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to their\\nheart\\'s content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a gale\\nblowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one\\'s feet\\non land. I suppose some unfriendly god had raised it for them, but on\\nthe thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they got away.\"\\n\\nMany a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept\\nas she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon the\\nmountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed upon\\nit and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even so did\\nher cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all the time\\nsitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was sorry for her, but he\\nkept his eyes as hard as horn or iron without letting them so much\\nas quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had\\nrelieved herself by weeping, she turned to him again and said: \"Now,\\nstranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or no you really\\ndid entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me, then,\\nhow he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look at, and so also\\nwith his companions.\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" answered Ulysses, \"it is such a long time ago that I can hardly\\nsay. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and went\\nelsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect. Ulysses\\nwore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened by a\\ngold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this there was\\na device that shewed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his fore paws,\\nand watching it as it lay panting upon the ground. Every one marvelled\\nat the way in which these things had been done in gold, the dog\\nlooking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was struggling\\nconvulsively to escape. {153} As for the shirt that he wore next his\\nskin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an onion, and\\nglistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women who beheld\\nit. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not\\nknow whether Ulysses wore these clothes when he left home, or whether\\none of his companions had given them to him while he was on his voyage;\\nor possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a present\\nof them, for he was a man of many friends and had few equals among the\\nAchaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple\\nmantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and I\\nsent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had a servant\\nwith him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was\\nlike; his shoulders were hunched, {154} he was dark, and he had thick\\ncurly hair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with greater\\nfamiliarity than he did any of the others, as being the most like-minded\\nwith himself.\"\\n\\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable\\nproofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found relief\\nin tears she said to him, \"Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you,\\nbut henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my house. It\\nwas I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I took them out of\\nthe store room and folded them up myself, and I gave him also the gold\\nbrooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him home\\nagain. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that detested city\\nwhose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure\\nyourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can\\nhardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and\\nborne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even\\nthough he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a god.\\nStill, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell you. I will hide\\nnothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately\\nheard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the\\nThesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has\\nbegged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew\\nwere lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and\\nthe sun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the\\nsun-god\\'s cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses\\nstuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the\\nPhaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him\\nas though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to\\nescort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here\\nlong ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering\\nwealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no\\none can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all\\nthis, and he swore to me--making drink-offerings in his house as he did\\nso--that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who would\\ntake Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there\\nhappened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing\\nisland of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses had got\\ntogether, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep\\nhis family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to\\nDodona that he might learn Jove\\'s mind from the high oak tree, and know\\nwhether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in\\nsecret. So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close\\nat hand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I\\nwill confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is the first and\\nmightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses to\\nwhich I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come to pass.\\nUlysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon\\nand the beginning of the next he will be here.\"\\n\\n\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true you\\nshall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you\\nshall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses\\nwill not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for so surely\\nas that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such masters in\\nthe house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or to further them\\non their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him, and make\\nhim a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may be warm and\\nquiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him again,\\nthat he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It\\nshall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to\\nhim; like it or not, he shall have no more to do in this house. For how,\\nsir, shall you be able to learn whether or no I am superior to others of\\nmy sex both in goodness of heart and understanding, if I let you dine in\\nmy cloisters squalid and ill clad? Men live but for a little season; if\\nthey are hard, and deal hardly, people wish them ill so long as they are\\nalive, and speak contemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that\\nis righteous and deals righteously, the people tell of his praise among\\nall lands, and many shall call him blessed.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the\\nday that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will\\nlie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after night\\nhave I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor,\\nagain, do I like having my feet washed; I shall not let any of the young\\nhussies about your house touch my feet; but, if you have any old and\\nrespectable woman who has gone through as much trouble as I have, I will\\nallow her to wash them.\"\\n\\nTo this Penelope said, \"My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet\\ncame to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with such\\nadmirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the house a most\\nrespectable old woman--the same who received my poor dear husband in\\nher arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She is\\nvery feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.\" \"Come here,\" said she,\\n\"Euryclea, and wash your master\\'s age-mate; I suppose Ulysses\\' hands and\\nfeet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages all of us\\ndreadfully fast.\"\\n\\nOn these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she began\\nto weep and made lamentation saying, \"My dear child, I cannot think\\nwhatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more\\ngod-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in the whole\\nworld ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs\\nwhen you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see your\\nson grow up to take after you: yet see how he has prevented you alone\\nfrom ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the women in\\nsome foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at him as all\\nthese sluts here have been gibing at you. I do not wonder at your\\nnot choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have\\ninsulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope\\nhas said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for Penelope\\'s\\nsake and for your own, for you have raised the most lively feelings of\\ncompassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, which pray attend\\nto; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before now,\\nbut I make bold to say that no one ever yet came who was so like Ulysses\\nin figure, voice, and feet as you are.\"\\n\\n\"Those who have seen us both,\" answered Ulysses, \"have always said we\\nwere wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.\"\\n\\nThen the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash his\\nfeet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot till the bath\\nwas warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he turned away\\nfrom the light, for it occurred to him that when the old woman had hold\\nof his leg she would recognise a certain scar which it bore, whereon the\\nwhole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing her\\nmaster, she at once knew the scar as one that had been given him by\\na wild boar when he was hunting on Mt. Parnassus with his excellent\\ngrandfather Autolycus--who was the most accomplished thief and perjurer\\nin the whole world--and with the sons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had\\nendowed him with this gift, for he used to burn the thigh bones of goats\\nand kids to him, so he took pleasure in his companionship. It happened\\nonce that Autolycus had gone to Ithaca and had found the child of his\\ndaughter just born. As soon as he had done supper Euryclea set the\\ninfant upon his knees and said, \"Autolycus, you must find a name for\\nyour grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one.\"\\n\\n\"Son-in-law and daughter,\" replied Autolycus, \"call the child thus: I\\nam highly displeased with a large number of people in one place and\\nanother, both men and women; so name the child \\'Ulysses,\\' or the child\\nof anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother\\'s family on Mt.\\nParnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a present and will\\nsend him on his way rejoicing.\"\\n\\nUlysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from\\nAutolycus, who with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome.\\nHis grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head,\\nand both his beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to get\\ndinner ready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five year\\nold bull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints; these\\nthey then cut carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them; they\\nroasted them sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus through\\nthe livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and every\\nman had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the sun set\\nand it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.\\n\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of\\nAutolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too.\\nThey climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy\\nupland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields,\\nfresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they came to a\\nmountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the\\nbeast they were chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolycus,\\namong whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had a long\\nspear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick\\nbrushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get through it, nor\\ncould the sun\\'s rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick\\nwith fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men\\'s feet, and the\\nhounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him, so he rushed\\nfrom his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at bay with\\nfire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first to raise his spear\\nand try to drive it into the brute, but the boar was too quick for him,\\nand charged him sideways, ripping him above the knee with a gash that\\ntore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar, Ulysses hit\\nhim on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear went right through\\nhim, so that he fell groaning in the dust until the life went out of\\nhim. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the carcass of the\\nboar, and bound Ulysses\\' wound; then, after saying a spell to stop the\\nbleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But when Autolycus and\\nhis sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made him some splendid\\npresents, and sent him back to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When\\nhe got back, his father and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked\\nhim all about it, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he\\ntold them how the boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with\\nAutolycus and his sons on Mt. Parnassus.\\n\\nAs soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well\\nhold of it, she recognised it and dropped the foot at once. The leg fell\\ninto the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that all the water\\nwas spilt on the ground; Euryclea\\'s eyes between her joy and her grief\\nfilled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught Ulysses\\nby the beard and said, \"My dear child, I am sure you must be Ulysses\\nhimself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched and handled\\nyou.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell her\\nthat her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable to\\nlook in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva had\\ndiverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with\\nhis right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said,\\n\"Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your own\\nbreast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to\\nmy own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to\\nrecognise me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about it to any\\none else in the house, for if you do I tell you--and it shall surely\\nbe--that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors, I will\\nnot spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing the other\\nwomen.\"\\n\\n\"My child,\" answered Euryclea, \"what are you talking about? You know\\nvery well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my\\ntongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay\\nmy saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors into your\\nhand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who have been\\nill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way; I am\\nwell able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your\\ntongue and leave everything to heaven.\"\\n\\nAs he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water, for\\nthe first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and anointed\\nhim with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to warm himself,\\nand hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began talking to him and\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another matter.\\nIt is indeed nearly bed time--for those, at least, who can sleep in\\nspite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such\\nunmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to my duties and\\nlooking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during the\\nwhole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed, I lie\\nawake thinking, and my heart becomes a prey to the most incessant and\\ncruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in\\nthe early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many\\na plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own\\nchild Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss and turn in\\nits uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard\\nmy substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard\\nto public opinion and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is\\nnot now time for me to go with the best of these suitors who are wooing\\nme and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was still\\nyoung, and unable to understand, he would not hear of my leaving my\\nhusband\\'s house, but now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to\\ndo so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his\\nproperty. Listen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for\\nme if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out\\nof a trough, {155} and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a\\ngreat eagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak\\ninto the neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently\\nhe soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;\\nwhereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me, so\\npiteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he\\ncame back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with\\nhuman voice, and told me to leave off crying. \\'Be of good courage,\\' he\\nsaid, \\'daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen\\nthat shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no\\nlonger an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who\\nwill bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.\\' On this I woke, and when\\nI looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual.\"\\n\\n\"This dream, Madam,\" replied Ulysses, \"can admit but of one\\ninterpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be\\nfulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single one\\nof them will escape.\"\\n\\nAnd Penelope answered, \"Stranger, dreams are very curious and\\nunaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably come true.\\nThere are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed;\\nthe one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come through\\nthe gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean\\nsomething to those that see them. I do not think, however, that my own\\ndream came through the gate of horn, though I and my son should be most\\nthankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say--and lay my\\nsaying to your heart--the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened day\\nthat is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am about to hold a\\ntournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes in the court,\\none in front of the other, like the stays upon which a ship is built;\\nhe would then go back from them and shoot an arrow through the whole\\ntwelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the same thing, and whichever\\nof them can string the bow most easily, and send his arrow through all\\nthe twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this house of my lawful\\nhusband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even so, I doubt not\\nthat I shall remember it in my dreams.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, you need not defer your\\ntournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow,\\nhandle it how they will, and send their arrows through the iron.\"\\n\\nTo this Penelope said, \"As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk\\nto me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do\\npermanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on earth\\na time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline upon\\nthat couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from the day\\nUlysses set out for the city with a hateful name.\"\\n\\nShe then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by her\\nmaidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till Minerva shed\\nsweet sleep over her eyelids.',\n",
       " 'BOOK I\\n\\n  The quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles--Achilles withdraws\\n  from the war, and sends his mother Thetis to ask Jove to help\\n  the Trojans--Scene between Jove and Juno on Olympus.\\n\\nSing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought\\ncountless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send\\nhurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and\\nvultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on\\nwhich the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell\\nout with one another.\\n\\nAnd which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the\\nson of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a\\npestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of\\nAtreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the\\nships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a\\ngreat ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo\\nwreathed with a suppliant\\'s wreath, and he besought the Achaeans, but\\nmost of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.\\n\\n\"Sons of Atreus,\" he cried, \"and all other Achaeans, may the gods who\\ndwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach your\\nhomes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, in\\nreverence to Apollo, son of Jove.\"\\n\\nOn this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting the\\npriest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, who\\nspoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. \"Old man,\" said he,\\n\"let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming\\nhereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you\\nnothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos\\nfar from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my\\ncouch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.\"\\n\\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by the\\nshore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom lovely\\nLeto had borne. \"Hear me,\" he cried, \"O god of the silver bow, that\\nprotectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might,\\nhear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple with\\ngarlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant my\\nprayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the Danaans.\"\\n\\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious\\nfrom the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his\\nshoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that\\ntrembled within him. He sat himself down away from the ships with a\\nface as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his\\narrow in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their\\nhounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, and\\nall day long the pyres of the dead were burning.\\n\\nFor nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon the\\ntenth day Achilles called them in assembly--moved thereto by Juno, who\\nsaw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon them.\\nThen, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.\\n\\n\"Son of Atreus,\" said he, \"I deem that we should now turn roving home\\nif we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and\\npestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some reader\\nof dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why Phoebus\\nApollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we have\\nbroken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will\\naccept the savour of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take\\naway the plague from us.\"\\n\\nWith these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest of\\naugurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He it\\nwas who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius, through the\\nprophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With all\\nsincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:--\\n\\n\"Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger of King\\nApollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear that you\\nwill stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that I shall\\noffend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the Achaeans\\nare in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger of a\\nking, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge\\ntill he has wreaked it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you will\\nprotect me.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon you\\nfrom heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose\\noracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand\\nupon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth--no, not\\nthough you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of the\\nAchaeans.\"\\n\\nThereon the seer spoke boldly. \"The god,\" he said, \"is angry neither\\nabout vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest\\'s sake, whom Agamemnon has\\ndishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take a ransom\\nfor her; therefore has he sent these evils upon us, and will yet send\\nothers. He will not deliver the Danaans from this pestilence till\\nAgamemnon has restored the girl without fee or ransom to her father,\\nand has sent a holy hecatomb to Chryse. Thus we may perhaps appease\\nhim.\"\\n\\nWith these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His heart\\nwas black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on Calchas\\nand said, \"Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth things\\nconcerning me, but have ever loved to foretell that which was evil. You\\nhave brought me neither comfort nor performance; and now you come\\nseeing among Danaans, and saying that Apollo has plagued us because I\\nwould not take a ransom for this girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have\\nset my heart on keeping her in my own house, for I love her better even\\nthan my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer she is alike in form and\\nfeature, in understanding and accomplishments. Still I will give her up\\nif I must, for I would have the people live, not die; but you must find\\nme a prize instead, or I alone among the Argives shall be without one.\\nThis is not well; for you behold, all of you, that my prize is to go\\nelsewhither.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond all\\nmankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have no\\ncommon store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities have\\nbeen awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made\\nalready. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jove grants\\nus to sack the city of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold.\"\\n\\nThen Agamemnon said, \"Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall not\\nthus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade me.\\nAre you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss and\\ngive up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize in\\nfair exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, or that\\nof Ajax or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shall rue my\\ncoming. But of this we will take thought hereafter; for the present,\\nlet us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her expressly; let\\nus put a hecatomb on board, and let us send Chryseis also; further, let\\nsome chief man among us be in command, either Ajax, or Idomeneus, or\\nyourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you are, that we may offer\\nsacrifice and appease the anger of the god.\"\\n\\nAchilles scowled at him and answered, \"You are steeped in insolence and\\nlust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your bidding,\\neither on foray or in open fighting? I came not warring here for any\\nill the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrel with them. They have not\\nraided my cattle nor my horses, nor cut down my harvests on the rich\\nplains of Phthia; for between me and them there is a great space, both\\nmountain and sounding sea. We have followed you, Sir Insolence! for\\nyour pleasure, not ours--to gain satisfaction from the Trojans for your\\nshameless self and for Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten to rob\\nme of the prize for which I have toiled, and which the sons of the\\nAchaeans have given me. Never when the Achaeans sack any rich city of\\nthe Trojans do I receive so good a prize as you do, though it is my\\nhands that do the better part of the fighting. When the sharing comes,\\nyour share is far the largest, and I, forsooth, must go back to my\\nships, take what I can get and be thankful, when my labour of fighting\\nis done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will be much\\nbetter for me to return home with my ships, for I will not stay here\\ndishonoured to gather gold and substance for you.\"\\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Fly if you will, I shall make you no prayers\\nto stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, and above all\\nJove, the lord of counsel. There is no king here so hateful to me as\\nyou are, for you are ever quarrelsome and ill-affected. What though you\\nbe brave? Was it not heaven that made you so? Go home, then, with your\\nships and comrades to lord it over the Myrmidons. I care neither for\\nyou nor for your anger; and thus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo is\\ntaking Chryseis from me, I shall send her with my ship and my\\nfollowers, but I shall come to your tent and take your own prize\\nBriseis, that you may learn how much stronger I am than you are, and\\nthat another may fear to set himself up as equal or comparable with me.\"\\n\\nThe son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy breast\\nwas divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside, and kill\\nthe son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check his anger. While he\\nwas thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from its\\nscabbard, Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno had sent her in the\\nlove she bore to them both), and seized the son of Peleus by his yellow\\nhair, visible to him alone, for of the others no man could see her.\\nAchilles turned in amaze, and by the fire that flashed from her eyes at\\nonce knew that she was Minerva. \"Why are you here,\" said he, \"daughter\\nof aegis-bearing Jove? To see the pride of Agamemnon, son of Atreus?\\nLet me tell you--and it shall surely be--he shall pay for this\\ninsolence with his life.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva said, \"I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to bid you\\nstay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of you alike.\\nCease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him if\\nyou will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you--and it\\nshall surely be--that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times as\\nsplendid by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore, and obey.\"\\n\\n\"Goddess,\" answered Achilles, \"however angry a man may be, he must do\\nas you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hear the\\nprayers of him who has obeyed them.\"\\n\\nHe stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust it back\\ninto the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back to Olympus\\namong the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing Jove.\\n\\nBut the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus, for he\\nwas still in a rage. \"Wine-bibber,\" he cried, \"with the face of a dog\\nand the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the host in\\nfight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun this as you\\ndo death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizes from any\\nman who contradicts you. You devour your people, for you are king over\\na feeble folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforward you would insult\\nno man. Therefore I say, and swear it with a great oath--nay, by this\\nmy sceptre which shalt sprout neither leaf nor shoot, nor bud anew from\\nthe day on which it left its parent stem upon the mountains--for the\\naxe stripped it of leaf and bark, and now the sons of the Achaeans bear\\nit as judges and guardians of the decrees of heaven--so surely and\\nsolemnly do I swear that hereafter they shall look fondly for Achilles\\nand shall not find him. In the day of your distress, when your men fall\\ndying by the murderous hand of Hector, you shall not know how to help\\nthem, and shall rend your heart with rage for the hour when you offered\\ninsult to the bravest of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nWith this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on the\\nground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginning\\nfiercely from his place upon the other side. Then uprose smooth-tongued\\nNestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians, and the words fell from his\\nlips sweeter than honey. Two generations of men born and bred in Pylos\\nhad passed away under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third.\\nWith all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:--\\n\\n\"Of a truth,\" he said, \"a great sorrow has befallen the Achaean land.\\nSurely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans be glad at\\nheart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are so\\nexcellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you;\\ntherefore be guided by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend of\\nmen even greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels.\\nNever again can I behold such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd of\\nhis people, or as Caeneus, Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus son\\nof Aegeus, peer of the immortals. These were the mightiest men ever\\nborn upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought the\\nfiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them. I came\\nfrom distant Pylos, and went about among them, for they would have me\\ncome, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now living could\\nwithstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded by them. So\\nbe it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellent way.\\nTherefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girl away,\\nfor the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to Achilles; and\\nyou, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man who by the\\ngrace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon. You are\\nstrong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon is stronger\\nthan you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus, check your\\nanger, I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who in the day of\\nbattle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, all that you have said is true, but this\\nfellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lord of all,\\nking of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be. Granted that\\nthe gods have made him a great warrior, have they also given him the\\nright to speak with railing?\"\\n\\nAchilles interrupted him. \"I should be a mean coward,\" he cried, \"were\\nI to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, not me,\\nfor I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say--and lay my saying to\\nyour heart--I shall fight neither you nor any man about this girl, for\\nthose that take were those also that gave. But of all else that is at\\nmy ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that others may\\nsee; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with your blood.\"\\n\\nWhen they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up the\\nassembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went back to\\nhis tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company, while\\nAgamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of twenty\\noarsmen. He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover a hecatomb for\\nthe god. And Ulysses went as captain.\\n\\nThese, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. But the\\nson of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they purified\\nthemselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they offered\\nhecatombs of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore, and the\\nsmoke with the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up towards heaven.\\n\\nThus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon did\\nnot forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trusty\\nmessengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. \"Go,\" said he, \"to the\\ntent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand and bring her\\nhither; if he will not give her I shall come with others and take\\nher--which will press him harder.\"\\n\\nHe charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon they\\nwent their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to the tents\\nand ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by his tent and\\nhis ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. They stood\\nfearfully and reverently before him, and never a word did they speak,\\nbut he knew them and said, \"Welcome, heralds, messengers of gods and\\nmen; draw near; my quarrel is not with you but with Agamemnon who has\\nsent you for the girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus, bring her and give\\nher to them, but let them be witnesses by the blessed gods, by mortal\\nmen, and by the fierceness of Agamemnon\\'s anger, that if ever again\\nthere be need of me to save the people from ruin, they shall seek and\\nthey shall not find. Agamemnon is mad with rage and knows not how to\\nlook before and after that the Achaeans may fight by their ships in\\nsafety.\"\\n\\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseis\\nfrom the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with them\\nto the ships of the Achaeans--and the woman was loth to go. Then\\nAchilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping and\\nlooking out upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in\\nprayer to his immortal mother, \"Mother,\" he cried, \"you bore me doomed\\nto live but for a little season; surely Jove, who thunders from\\nOlympus, might have made that little glorious. It is not so. Agamemnon,\\nson of Atreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed me of my prize by\\nforce.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was\\nsitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father.\\nForthwith she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down\\nbefore him as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and said,\\n\"My son, why are you weeping? What is it that grieves you? Keep it not\\nfrom me, but tell me, that we may know it together.\"\\n\\nAchilles drew a deep sigh and said, \"You know it; why tell you what you\\nknow well already? We went to Thebe the strong city of Eetion, sacked\\nit, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the Achaeans shared it\\nduly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis as the meed of\\nAgamemnon; but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to the ships of the\\nAchaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him a great ransom:\\nmoreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo, wreathed with a\\nsuppliant\\'s wreath, and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the\\ntwo sons of Atreus who were their chiefs.\\n\\n\"On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting\\nthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,\\nwho spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. So he went back in\\nanger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer. Then the god\\nsent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the people died thick on one\\nanother, for the arrows went everywhither among the wide host of the\\nAchaeans. At last a seer in the fulness of his knowledge declared to us\\nthe oracles of Apollo, and I was myself first to say that we should\\nappease him. Whereon the son of Atreus rose in anger, and threatened\\nthat which he has since done. The Achaeans are now taking the girl in a\\nship to Chryse, and sending gifts of sacrifice to the god; but the\\nheralds have just taken from my tent the daughter of Briseus, whom the\\nAchaeans had awarded to myself.\\n\\n\"Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, and if\\nyou have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid of\\nJove. Ofttimes in my father\\'s house have I heard you glory in that you\\nalone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin, when the\\nothers, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have put him in\\nbonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to Olympus the\\nhundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but men Aegaeon, for he\\nis stronger even than his father; when therefore he took his seat\\nall-glorious beside the son of Saturn, the other gods were afraid, and\\ndid not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of all this, clasp his\\nknees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans. Let the Achaeans be\\nhemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perish on the sea-shore,\\nthat they may reap what joy they may of their king, and that Agamemnon\\nmay rue his blindness in offering insult to the foremost of the\\nAchaeans.\"\\n\\nThetis wept and answered, \"My son, woe is me that I should have borne\\nor suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span free from all\\nsorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you should be\\nat once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers: woe,\\ntherefore, was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless I will go to\\nthe snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove, if he will\\nhear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with your ships, nurse\\nyour anger against the Achaeans, and hold aloof from fight. For Jove\\nwent yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast among the Ethiopians, and the\\nother gods went with him. He will return to Olympus twelve days hence;\\nI will then go to his mansion paved with bronze and will beseech him;\\nnor do I doubt that I shall be able to persuade him.\"\\n\\nOn this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had been\\ntaken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb.\\nWhen they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laid\\nthem in the ship\\'s hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the mast\\ninto its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they would have\\nher lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast the\\nhawsers. They then got out upon the sea-shore and landed the hecatomb\\nfor Apollo; Chryseis also left the ship, and Ulysses led her to the\\naltar to deliver her into the hands of her father. \"Chryses,\" said he,\\n\"King Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your child, and to offer\\nsacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that we may propitiate\\nthe god, who has now brought sorrow upon the Argives.\"\\n\\nSo saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her gladly,\\nand they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the altar of the\\ngod. They washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle\\nover the victims, while Chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud on\\ntheir behalf. \"Hear me,\" he cried, \"O god of the silver bow, that\\nprotectest Chryse and holy Cilla, and rulest Tenedos with thy might.\\nEven as thou didst hear me aforetime when I prayed, and didst press\\nhardly upon the Achaeans, so hear me yet again, and stay this fearful\\npestilence from the Danaans.\"\\n\\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done\\npraying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of the\\nvictims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the thigh-bones,\\nwrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat on\\nthe top of them, and then Chryses laid them on the wood fire and poured\\nwine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged\\nspits in their hands. When the thigh-bones were burned and they had\\ntasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces\\nupon the spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off:\\nthen, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, they\\nate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied.\\nAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, pages filled the\\nmixing-bowl with wine and water and handed it round, after giving every\\nman his drink-offering.\\n\\nThus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning\\nhim and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in their\\nvoices; but when the sun went down, and it came on dark, they laid\\nthemselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship, and when the\\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they again set sail for\\nthe host of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fair wind, so they raised\\ntheir mast and hoisted their white sails aloft. As the sail bellied\\nwith the wind the ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foam\\nhissed against her bows as she sped onward. When they reached the\\nwide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they drew the vessel ashore, high\\nand dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath her, and went\\ntheir ways to their own tents and ships.\\n\\nBut Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not to\\nthe honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed at\\nhis own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.\\n\\nNow after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to Olympus,\\nand Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the charge her son\\nhad laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and went through\\ngreat heaven with early morning to Olympus, where she found the mighty\\nson of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost ridges. She sat\\nherself down before him, and with her left hand seized his knees, while\\nwith her right she caught him under the chin, and besought him,\\nsaying:--\\n\\n\"Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the\\nimmortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is to be\\ncut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking his\\nprize and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lord of\\ncounsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans give my\\nson his due and load him with riches in requital.\"\\n\\nJove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still kept\\nfirm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time. \"Incline your\\nhead,\" said she, \"and promise me surely, or else deny me--for you have\\nnothing to fear--that I may learn how greatly you disdain me.\"\\n\\nAt this Jove was much troubled and answered, \"I shall have trouble if\\nyou set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me with her\\ntaunting speeches; even now she is always railing at me before the\\nother gods and accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back now,\\nlest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and will bring it\\nabout as you wish. See, I incline my head that you may believe me. This\\nis the most solemn promise that I can give to any god. I never recall\\nmy word, or deceive, or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded my\\nhead.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the ambrosial\\nlocks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus reeled.\\n\\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted--Jove to his\\nhouse, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plunged\\ninto the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before the\\ncoming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting, but all\\nstood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat. But\\nJuno, when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman\\'s daughter,\\nsilver-footed Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began\\nto upbraid him. \"Trickster,\" she cried, \"which of the gods have you\\nbeen taking into your counsels now? You are always settling matters in\\nsecret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could help\\nit, one word of your intentions.\"\\n\\n\"Juno,\" replied the sire of gods and men, \"you must not expect to be\\ninformed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find it\\nhard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there is no\\none, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep a\\nmatter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions.\"\\n\\n\"Dread son of Saturn,\" answered Juno, \"what are you talking about? I?\\nPry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in\\neverything. Still, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman\\'s\\ndaughter Thetis has been talking you over, for she was with you and had\\nhold of your knees this self-same morning. I believe, therefore, that\\nyou have been promising her to give glory to Achilles, and to kill much\\npeople at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\n\"Wife,\" said Jove, \"I can do nothing but you suspect me and find it\\nout. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you the\\nmore, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you say; I\\nmean to have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bid you for if I\\nonce begin to lay my hands about you, though all heaven were on your\\nside it would profit you nothing.\"\\n\\nOn this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and sat\\ndown in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughout the\\nhouse of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try and pacify\\nhis mother Juno. \"It will be intolerable,\" said he, \"if you two fall to\\nwrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack of mortals. If\\nsuch ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no pleasure at our\\nbanquet. Let me then advise my mother--and she must herself know that\\nit will be better--to make friends with my dear father Jove, lest he\\nagain scold her and disturb our feast. If the Olympian Thunderer wants\\nto hurl us all from our seats, he can do so, for he is far the\\nstrongest, so give him fair words, and he will then soon be in a good\\nhumour with us.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his\\nmother\\'s hand. \"Cheer up, my dear mother,\" said he, \"and make the best\\nof it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get a\\nthrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not help, for there is\\nno standing against Jove. Once before when I was trying to help you, he\\ncaught me by the foot and flung me from the heavenly threshold. All day\\nlong from morn till eve, was I falling, till at sunset I came to ground\\nin the island of Lemnos, and there I lay, with very little life left in\\nme, till the Sintians came and tended me.\"\\n\\nJuno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her son\\'s\\nhands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and served\\nit round among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed gods\\nlaughed out a loud applause as they saw him bustling about the heavenly\\nmansion.\\n\\nThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they\\nfeasted, and every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied.\\nApollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices,\\ncalling and answering one another. But when the sun\\'s glorious light\\nhad faded, they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame\\nVulcan with his consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove, the\\nOlympian Lord of Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he always slept;\\nand when he had got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the golden\\nthrone by his side.',\n",
       " 'Book XVI\\n\\nULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were\\nwere getting breakfast ready at daybreak, for they had sent the men out\\nwith the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark but fawned\\nupon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and noticing that the\\ndogs did not bark, said to Eumaeus:\\n\\n\"Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of\\nyour acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning upon him and\\nnot barking.\"\\n\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the door.\\nEumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing wine\\nfell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his head\\nand both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not be\\nmore delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his old age,\\nafter ten years\\' absence in a foreign country and after having gone\\nthrough much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as though he\\nhad come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:\\n\\n\"So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When I\\nheard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you any\\nmore. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good look\\nat you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into\\nthe country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town\\ngenerally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the\\nsuitors are doing.\"\\n\\n\"So be it, old friend,\" answered Telemachus, \"but I am come now because\\nI want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is still at her\\nold home or whether some one else has married her, so that the bed of\\nUlysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs.\"\\n\\n\"She is still at the house,\" replied Eumaeus, \"grieving and breaking her\\nheart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he took Telemachus\\' spear, whereon he crossed the stone\\nthreshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him place\\nas he entered, but Telemachus checked him; \"Sit down, stranger,\" said\\nhe, \"I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who will lay\\nit for me.\"\\n\\nUlysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green\\nbrushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for Telemachus\\nto sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of cold meat, the\\nremains from what they had eaten the day before, and he filled the bread\\nbaskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine also in bowls of\\nivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they laid their hands\\non the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had\\nenough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus, \"Old friend, where\\ndoes this stranger come from? How did his crew bring him to Ithaca, and\\nwho were they?--for assuredly he did not come here by land.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"My son, I will tell you\\nthe real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great\\ntraveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,\\nand has taken refuge at my station, so I will put him into your hands.\\nDo whatever you like with him, only remember that he is your suppliant.\"\\n\\n\"I am very much distressed,\" said Telemachus, \"by what you have just\\ntold me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young,\\nand am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My mother\\ncannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and look after the\\nhouse out of respect for public opinion and the memory of her husband,\\nor whether the time is now come for her to take the best man of those\\nwho are wooing her, and the one who will make her the most advantageous\\noffer; still, as the stranger has come to your station I will find him\\na cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals, and will send\\nhim wherever he wants to go. Or if you like you can keep him here at the\\nstation, and I will send him clothes and food that he may be no burden\\non you and on your men; but I will not have him go near the suitors,\\nfor they are very insolent, and are sure to ill treat him in a way that\\nwould greatly grieve me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do\\nnothing against numbers, for they will be too strong for him.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses said, \"Sir, it is right that I should say something myself.\\nI am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent way in\\nwhich the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you are. Tell\\nme, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some god set your\\npeople against you? May you not complain of your brothers--for it is to\\nthese that a man may look for support, however great his quarrel may be?\\nI wish I were as young as you are and in my present mind; if I were son\\nto Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would rather some one came\\nand cut my head off, but I would go to the house and be the bane of\\nevery one of these men. {139} If they were too many for me--I being\\nsingle-handed--I would rather die fighting in my own house than see such\\ndisgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men\\ndragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way, wine\\ndrawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that\\nshall never be accomplished.\"\\n\\nAnd Telemachus answered, \"I will tell you truly everything. There is no\\nenmity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, to whom\\na man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove has\\nmade us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius, and\\nUlysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son of Ulysses who\\nleft me behind him when he went away, so that I have never been of any\\nuse to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of numberless\\nmarauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands, Dulichium,\\nSame, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are\\neating up my house under the pretext of paying court to my mother, who\\nwill neither say point blank that she will not marry, nor yet bring\\nmatters to an end, so they are making havoc of my estate, and before\\nlong will do so with myself into the bargain. The issue, however,\\nrests with heaven. But do you, old friend Eumaeus, go at once and tell\\nPenelope that I am safe and have returned from Pylos. Tell it to herself\\nalone, and then come back here without letting any one else know, for\\nthere are many who are plotting mischief against me.\"\\n\\n\"I understand and heed you,\" replied Eumaeus; \"you need instruct me no\\nfurther, only as I am going that way say whether I had not better let\\npoor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend the work\\non his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses, and he would\\neat and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell me that\\nfrom the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten nor\\ndrunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after his farm, but sits\\nweeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.\"\\n\\n\"More\\'s the pity,\" answered Telemachus, \"I am sorry for him, but we must\\nleave him to himself just now. If people could have everything their own\\nway, the first thing I should choose would be the return of my father;\\nbut go, and give your message; then make haste back again, and do not\\nturn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother to send one of her\\nwomen secretly with the news at once, and let him hear it from her.\"\\n\\nThus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals,\\nbound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched\\nhim well off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a\\nwoman--fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the entry,\\nand revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see her, and\\nknew not that she was there, for the gods do not let themselves be seen\\nby everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs, for they did not\\nbark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of the yards.\\nShe nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with her eyebrows; whereon\\nhe left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the yards.\\nThen she said to him:\\n\\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell your\\nson: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for the\\ndestruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will not be\\nlong in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw\\na fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him\\nyounger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,\\nfilled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she\\nwent away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded\\nwhen he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking\\nupon a god.\\n\\n\"Stranger,\" said he, \"how suddenly you have changed from what you were\\na moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your colour is not\\nthe same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If\\nso, be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings\\nof wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses said, \"I am no god, why should you take me for one? I am\\nyour father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the hands\\nof lawless men.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on to the\\nground, for he had restrained all tears till now. But Telemachus could\\nnot yet believe that it was his father, and said:\\n\\n\"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes\\nthat I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself\\ncontrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young\\nat a moment\\'s notice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you\\nwere old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down from\\nheaven.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably\\nastonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who will\\ncome hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and much\\nhardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country. What you\\nwonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, who does with\\nme whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. At one moment she\\nmakes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man with good clothes\\non my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in heaven to make\\nany man look either rich or poor.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father\\nand wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like eagles\\nor vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their half\\nfledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the sun\\nwould have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had not suddenly\\nsaid, \"In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you to Ithaca?\\nOf what nation did they declare themselves to be--for you cannot have\\ncome by land?\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" replied Ulysses. \"It was the\\nPhaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the\\nhabit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took\\nme over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca, after\\ngiving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These things by\\nheaven\\'s mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now come here on\\nthe suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about killing our enemies.\\nFirst, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with their number, that\\nI may learn who, and how many, they are. I can then turn the matter\\nover in my mind, and see whether we two can fight the whole body of them\\nourselves, or whether we must find others to help us.\"\\n\\nTo this Telemachus answered, \"Father, I have always heard of your renown\\nboth in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a very\\ngreat one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot stand\\nagainst many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor twice\\nten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at once.\\nThere are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium, and they have six\\nservants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young Achaeans from\\nZacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well born. They\\nhave with them a servant Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve at\\ntable. If we face such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to rue\\nyour coming, and your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some one\\nwho would be willing to come and help us.\"\\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" replied Ulysses, \"and think whether Minerva and her\\nfather Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find some\\none else as well.\"\\n\\n\"Those whom you have named,\" answered Telemachus, \"are a couple of good\\nallies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have power\\nover both gods and men.\"\\n\\n\"These two,\" continued Ulysses, \"will not keep long out of the fray,\\nwhen the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return\\nhome early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as\\nbefore. Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a\\nmiserable old beggar. If you see them ill treating me, steel your heart\\nagainst my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of\\nthe house, or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently\\ntrying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to\\nyou, for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and\\nlay my saying to your heart; when Minerva shall put it in my mind, I\\nwill nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all\\nthe armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room.\\nMake some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say\\nthat you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it\\nis no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled\\nand begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you are\\nafraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that they\\nmay do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and wooing,\\nfor the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them. But leave\\na sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a couple of oxhide\\nshields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and Minerva\\nwill then soon quiet these people. There is also another matter; if you\\nare indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that\\nUlysses is within the house--neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor\\nany of the servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let you and me exploit\\nthe women alone, and let us also make trial of some other of the men\\nservants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is against us.\"\\n\\n\"Father,\" replied Telemachus, \"you will come to know me by and by, and\\nwhen you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not think,\\nhowever, the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us. Think\\nit over. It will take us a long time to go the round of the farms and\\nexploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be wasting your\\nestate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the women by all\\nmeans, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but I am not in favour\\nof going round and trying the men. We can attend to that later on, if\\nyou really have some sign from Jove that he will support you.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought\\nTelemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When\\nthey had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land;\\ntheir servants came and took their armour from them, and they left all\\nthe presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant to tell\\nPenelope that Telemachus had gone into the country, but had sent the\\nship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.\\nThis servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the\\nsame errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House, the\\nservant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the waiting\\nwomen, \"Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos\"; but Eumaeus went\\nclose up to Penelope, and said privately all that her son had bidden\\nhim tell her. When he had given his message he left the house with its\\noutbuildings and went back to his pigs again.\\n\\nThe suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they\\nwent outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held\\na council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the\\nfirst to speak.\\n\\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"this voyage of Telemachus\\'s is a very serious\\nmatter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however,\\nlet us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send after\\nthe others and tell them to come back as fast as they can.\"\\n\\nHe had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and\\nsaw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails, and\\nputting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others, \"We need\\nnot send them any message, for they are here. Some god must have told\\nthem, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake her.\"\\n\\nOn this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the\\nship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they went\\nup in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let any one\\nold or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke\\nfirst.\\n\\n\"Good heavens,\" said he, \"see how the gods have saved this man from\\ndestruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all day\\nlong, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep, but\\nwaited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and\\nkilling him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let\\nus consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our\\naffair is never likely to come off while he is alive, for he is very\\nshrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on our side. We must make\\nhaste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he will lose no time\\nin doing so, for he will be furious with us, and will tell all the world\\nhow we plotted to kill him, but failed to take him. The people will not\\nlike this when they come to know of it; we must see that they do us no\\nhurt, nor drive us from our own country into exile. Let us try and\\nlay hold of him either on his farm away from the town, or on the road\\nhither. Then we can divide up his property amongst us, and let his\\nmother and the man who marries her have the house. If this does not\\nplease you, and you wish Telemachus to live on and hold his father\\'s\\nproperty, then we must not gather here and eat up his goods in this way,\\nbut must make our offers to Penelope each from his own house, and she\\ncan marry the man who will give the most for her, and whose lot it is to\\nwin her.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the son\\nof Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among all the\\nsuitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of Dulichium; his\\nconversation, moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that of any\\nof the other suitors, for he was a man of good natural disposition. \"My\\nfriends,\" said he, speaking to them plainly and in all honestly, \"I am\\nnot in favour of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous thing to kill one\\nwho is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of the gods, and if the\\noracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to kill him myself, and will\\nurge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade us, I would have you\\nhold your hands.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose\\nforthwith and went to the house of Ulysses, where they took their\\naccustomed seats.\\n\\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. She\\nknew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had overheard\\ntheir counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to the court\\nattended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she stood by\\none of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister holding a\\nveil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:\\n\\n\"Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best\\nspeaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are\\nnothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the death\\nof Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness is Jove\\nhimself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one another.\\nDo you not remember how your father fled to this house in fear of the\\npeople, who were enraged against him for having gone with some Taphian\\npirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us? They\\nwanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses\\nstayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour his\\nproperty without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his wife\\nand trying to kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the others\\nalso.\"\\n\\nTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, \"Take heart, Queen Penelope\\ndaughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters.\\nThe man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon\\nyour son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the\\nearth. I say--and it shall surely be--that my spear shall be reddened\\nwith his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees,\\nheld wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands.\\nTherefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing\\nto fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to him\\nfrom the gods, he cannot escape it.\" He said this to quiet her, but in\\nreality he was plotting against Telemachus.\\n\\nThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva\\nshed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses\\nand his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were\\nhelping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to\\nUlysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke of her wand, and\\nclad him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd might\\nrecognise him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope.\\n\\nTelemachus was the first to speak. \"So you have got back, Eumaeus,\" said\\nhe. \"What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned, or are\\nthey still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?\"\\n\\n\"I did not think of asking about that,\" replied Eumaeus, \"when I was in\\nthe town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon as I\\ncould. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos, and he\\nwas the first to tell the news to your mother, but I can say what I saw\\nwith my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the hill of Mercury\\nabove the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour with a number of\\nmen in her. They had many shields and spears, and I thought it was the\\nsuitors, but I cannot be sure.\"\\n\\nOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus\\ncould not see him.\\n\\nThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they ate\\nit, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As\\nsoon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest and\\nenjoyed the boon of sleep.',\n",
       " 'BOOK VII\\n\\n  Hector and Ajax fight--Hector is getting worsted when night\\n  comes on and parts them--They exchange presents--The\\n  burial of the dead, and the building of a wall round their\\n  ships by the Achaeans--The Achaeans buy their wine of\\n  Agamemnon and Menelaus.\\n\\nWITH these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother\\nAlexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends a\\nbreeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and have\\nlaboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even so welcome\\nwas the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans.\\n\\nThereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he lived in\\nArne, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and of Phylomedusa. Hector\\nthrew a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead with a wound in the neck\\nunder the bronze rim of his helmet. Glaucus, moreover, son of\\nHippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in hard hand-to-hand fight smote\\nIphinous son of Dexius on the shoulder, as he was springing on to his\\nchariot behind his fleet mares; so he fell to earth from the car, and\\nthere was no life left in him.\\n\\nWhen, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the Argives, she\\ndarted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus, and Apollo, who was\\nlooking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for he wanted the\\nTrojans to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, and King Apollo\\nson of Jove was first to speak. \"What would you have,\" said he,\\n\"daughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sent you hither\\nfrom Olympus? Have you no pity upon the Trojans, and would you incline\\nthe scales of victory in favour of the Danaans? Let me persuade\\nyou--for it will be better thus--stay the combat for to-day, but let\\nthem renew the fight hereafter till they compass the doom of Ilius,\\nsince you goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva answered, \"So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind that I\\ncame down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me, then, how\\ndo you propose to end this present fighting?\"\\n\\nApollo, son of Jove, replied, \"Let us incite great Hector to challenge\\nsome one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the Achaeans will be\\nshamed into finding a man who will fight him.\"\\n\\nMinerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel of the\\ngods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, \"Hector son of Priam,\\npeer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then persuade you.\\nBid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take their seats, and\\nchallenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet you in single combat.\\nI have heard the voice of the ever-living gods, and the hour of your\\ndoom is not yet come.\"\\n\\nHector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the\\nTrojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and they\\nall sat down. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. But Minerva\\nand Apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on father Jove\\'s high\\noak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat close ranged together,\\nbristling with shield and helmet and spear. As when the rising west\\nwind furs the face of the sea and the waters grow dark beneath it, so\\nsat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon the plain. And Hector\\nspoke thus:--\\n\\n\"Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am minded;\\nJove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants to nothing,\\nand foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take the towers of\\nTroy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. The princes of the\\nAchaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him, then, that will\\nfight me stand forward as your champion against Hector. Thus I say, and\\nmay Jove be witness between us. If your champion slay me, let him strip\\nme of my armour and take it to your ships, but let him send my body\\nhome that the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when\\nI am dead. In like manner, if Apollo vouchsafe me glory and I slay your\\nchampion, I will strip him of his armour and take it to the city of\\nIlius, where I will hang it in the temple of Apollo, but I will give up\\nhis body, that the Achaeans may bury him at their ships, and the build\\nhim a mound by the wide waters of the Hellespont. Then will one say\\nhereafter as he sails his ship over the sea, \\'This is the monument of\\none who died long since a champion who was slain by mighty Hector.\\'\\nThus will one say, and my fame shall not be lost.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to decline\\nthe challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaus rose and\\nrebuked them, for he was angry. \"Alas,\" he cried, \"vain braggarts,\\nwomen forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon us if\\nno man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned every man\\nof you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious in\\nyour places. I will myself go out against this man, but the upshot of\\nthe fight will be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your life\\nwould have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for he was\\nfar better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung upon you\\nand checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand and said,\\n\"Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be patient in spite of\\npassion, do not think of fighting a man so much stronger than yourself\\nas Hector son of Priam, who is feared by many another as well as you.\\nEven Achilles, who is far more doughty than you are, shrank from\\nmeeting him in battle. Sit down your own people, and the Achaeans will\\nsend some other champion to fight Hector; fearless and fond of battle\\nthough he be, I ween his knees will bend gladly under him if he comes\\nout alive from the hurly-burly of this fight.\"\\n\\nWith these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,\\nwhereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders.\\nThen Nestor rose and spoke, \"Of a truth,\" said he, \"the Achaean land is\\nfallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor and orator\\namong the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house to question me\\nconcerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. How would it not\\ngrieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before Hector? Many a\\ntime would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul might leave his\\nbody and go down within the house of Hades. Would, by father Jove,\\nMinerva, and Apollo, that I were still young and strong as when the\\nPylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Celadon\\nunder the walls of Pheia, and round about the waters of the river\\nIardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their champion,\\nwith the armour of King Areithous upon his shoulders--Areithous whom\\nmen and women had surnamed \\'the Mace-man,\\' because he fought neither\\nwith bow nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his iron\\nmace. Lycurgus killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him in\\na narrow way where his mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus was\\ntoo quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell to\\nearth on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him of the armour which Mars\\nhad given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when he grew\\nold and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire Ereuthalion,\\nwho in this same armour challenged the foremost men among us. The\\nothers quaked and quailed, but my high spirit bade me fight him though\\nnone other would venture; I was the youngest man of them all; but when\\nI fought him Minerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the biggest and\\nstrongest man that ever I killed, and covered much ground as he lay\\nsprawling upon the earth. Would that I were still young and strong as I\\nthen was, for the son of Priam would then soon find one who would face\\nhim. But you, foremost among the whole host though you be, have none of\\nyou any stomach for fighting Hector.\"\\n\\nThus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started to\\ntheir feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after him brave\\nDiomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men clothed in\\nvalour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his brother\\nin arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon, Thoas the son of\\nAndraemon, and Ulysses also rose. Then Nestor knight of Gerene again\\nspoke, saying: \"Cast lots among you to see who shall be chosen. If he\\ncome alive out of this fight he will have done good service alike to\\nhis own soul and to the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had thrown\\nit into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people lifted their\\nhands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he looked into the\\nvault of heaven, \"Father Jove, grant that the lot fall on Ajax, or on\\nthe son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycene himself.\"\\n\\nAs they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, and\\nfrom it there fell the very lot which they wanted--the lot of Ajax. The\\nherald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of the\\nAchaeans, going from left to right; but they none of them owned it.\\nWhen, however, in due course he reached the man who had written upon it\\nand had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, and the\\nherald gave him the lot. When Ajax saw his mark he knew it and was\\nglad; he threw it to the ground and said, \"My friends, the lot is mine,\\nand I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put on my armour;\\nmeanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among yourselves that the\\nTrojans may not hear you--or aloud if you will, for we fear no man.\\nNone shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for I was born\\nand bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.\"\\n\\nWith this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thus\\nwould one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, \"Father\\nJove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory to\\nAjax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hector also\\nand would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and prowess.\"\\n\\nThus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming\\nbronze. When he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous Mars\\nwhen he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with one\\nanother--even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, spring forward\\nwith a grim smile on his face as he brandished his long spear and\\nstrode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him, but the\\nTrojans trembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hector beat\\nquickly, but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks\\nbehind him, for he had been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his\\nshield in front of him like a wall--a shield of bronze with seven folds\\nof oxhide--the work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far the\\nbest worker in leather. He had made it with the hides of seven full-fed\\nbulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. Holding\\nthis shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector,\\nand menaced him saying, \"Hector, you shall now learn, man to man, what\\nkind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lion-hearted\\nAchilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at the ships in\\nanger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of us\\nwho are well able to face you; therefore begin the fight.\"\\n\\nAnd Hector answered, \"Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the host,\\ntreat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannot fight.\\nI have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle. I am quick\\nto turn my leathern shield either to right or left, for this I deem the\\nmain thing in battle. I can charge among the chariots and horsemen, and\\nin hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Mars; howbeit I would\\nnot take such a man as you are off his guard--but I will smite you\\nopenly if I can.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struck the\\nsevenfold shield in its outermost layer--the eighth, which was of\\nbronze--and went through six of the layers but in the seventh hide it\\nstayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round shield of the\\nson of Priam. The terrible spear went through his gleaming shield, and\\npressed onward through his cuirass of cunning workmanship; it pierced\\nthe shirt against his side, but he swerved and thus saved his life.\\nThey then each of them drew out the spear from his shield, and fell on\\none another like savage lions or wild boars of great strength and\\nendurance: the son of Priam struck the middle of Ajax\\'s shield, but the\\nbronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned. Ajax then\\nsprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector; the spear went through\\nit and staggered him as he was springing forward to attack; it gashed\\nhis neck and the blood came pouring from the wound, but even so Hector\\ndid not cease fighting; he gave ground, and with his brawny hand seized\\na stone, rugged and huge, that was lying upon the plain; with this he\\nstruck the shield of Ajax on the boss that was in its middle, so that\\nthe bronze rang again. But Ajax in turn caught up a far larger stone,\\nswung it aloft, and hurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of\\na rock broke Hector\\'s shield inwards and threw him down on his back\\nwith the shield crushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at once.\\nThereon they would have hacked at one another in close combat with\\ntheir swords, had not heralds, messengers of gods and men, come\\nforward, one from the Trojans and the other from the\\nAchaeans--Talthybius and Idaeus both of them honourable men; these\\nparted them with their staves, and the good herald Idaeus said, \"My\\nsons, fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both are dear\\nto Jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the behests of\\nnight may not be well gainsaid.\"\\n\\nAjax son of Telamon answered, \"Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it was he\\nthat challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I will accept his\\nsaying.\"\\n\\nThen Hector said, \"Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and\\nstrength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all others\\nof the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we will\\nfight anew till heaven decide between us, and give victory to one or to\\nthe other; night is now falling, and the behests of night may not be\\nwell gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts of the Achaeans at your ships,\\nand more especially those of your own followers and clansmen, while I,\\nin the great city of King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans and their\\nwomen, who vie with one another in their prayers on my behalf. Let us,\\nmoreover, exchange presents that it may be said among the Achaeans and\\nTrojans, \\'They fought with might and main, but were reconciled and\\nparted in friendship.\\'\"\\n\\nOn this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and\\nleathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with\\npurple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans,\\nand the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw their\\nhero come to them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty\\nAjax. They led him, therefore, to the city as one that had been saved\\nbeyond their hopes. On the other side the Achaeans brought Ajax elated\\nwith victory to Agamemnon.\\n\\nWhen they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon\\nsacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the son of\\nSaturn. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into\\njoints; these they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting them\\non the spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them off.\\nWhen they had done all this and had prepared the feast, they ate it,\\nand every man had his full and equal share, so that all were satisfied,\\nand King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin,\\nas a mark of special honour. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\\ndrink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak; with\\nall sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:--\\n\\n\"Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the Achaeans\\nare now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of the Scamander,\\nand their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, it will be well\\nwhen morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will then wheel\\nour dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not far from the\\nships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of our comrades\\nhome to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow\\nthat shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let us\\nset about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our ships, and\\nlet it have well-made gates that there may be a way through them for\\nour chariots. Close outside we will dig a deep trench all round it to\\nkeep off both horse and foot, that the Trojan chieftains may not bear\\nhard upon us.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile the\\nTrojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis by\\nthe gates of King Priam\\'s palace; and wise Antenor spoke. \"Hear me,\" he\\nsaid, \"Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even as I am\\nminded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the sons of\\nAtreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn covenants,\\nand shall not prosper till we have done as I say.\"\\n\\nHe then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to speak.\\n\"Antenor,\" said he, \"your words are not to my liking; you can find a\\nbetter saying than this if you will; if, however, you have spoken in\\ngood earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your reason. I will\\nspeak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans that I will not give up\\nthe woman; but the wealth that I brought home with her from Argos I\\nwill restore, and will add yet further of my own.\"\\n\\nOn this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the race of\\nDardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity and\\ngoodwill addressed them thus: \"Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and\\nallies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers now as\\nhitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful. At\\ndaybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and Menelaus\\nsons of Atreus the saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has\\ncome about; and let him also be instant with them that they now cease\\nfighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till\\nheaven decide between us and give victory to one or to the other.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took supper\\nin their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his way to the ships. He\\nfound the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern of\\nAgamemnon\\'s ship, and took his place in the midst of them. \"Son of\\nAtreus,\" he said, \"and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and the other\\nnoble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of Alexandrus through\\nwhom this quarrel has come about, if so be that you may find it\\nacceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his ships to\\nTroy--would that he had sooner perished--he will restore, and will add\\nyet further of his own, but he will not give up the wedded wife of\\nMenelaus, though the Trojans would have him do so. Priam bade me\\ninquire further if you will cease fighting till we burn our dead;\\nhereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between us and give\\nvictory to one or to the other.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud war-cry\\nspoke, saying, \"Let there be no taking, neither treasure, nor yet\\nHelen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans is at\\nhand.\"\\n\\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomed had\\nspoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, \"Idaeus, you have\\nheard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But as\\nconcerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men are\\nonce dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let Jove\\nthe mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods, and\\nIdaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and\\nDardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when he came,\\nhe stood in their midst and delivered his message. As soon as they\\nheard it they set about their twofold labour, some to gather the\\ncorpses, and others to bring in wood. The Argives on their part also\\nhastened from their ships, some to gather the corpses, and others to\\nbring in wood.\\n\\nThe sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into the\\nvault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, when the\\ntwo armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but they washed\\nthe clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, and lifted them\\nupon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to wail aloud, so\\nthey heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and having\\nburned them went back to the city of Ilius. The Achaeans in like manner\\nheaped their dead sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned\\nthem went back to their ships.\\n\\nNow in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the\\nAchaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that was\\nraised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall to\\nshelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates that\\nthere might be a way through them for their chariots, and close outside\\nit they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within with\\nstakes.\\n\\nThus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jove\\nthe lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune, lord\\nof the earthquake, spoke, saying, \"Father Jove, what mortal in the\\nwhole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you not how\\nthe Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven a trench\\nall round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The fame of this\\nwall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will no longer think\\nanything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself built with so much\\nlabour for Laomedon.\"\\n\\nJove was displeased and answered, \"What, O shaker of the earth, are you\\ntalking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be alarmed at\\nwhat they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn itself.\\nSurely when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships, you can\\nshatter their wall and fling it into the sea; you can cover the beach\\nwith sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be\\nutterly effaced.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans was\\ncompleted; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got their\\nsupper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus the\\nson of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freighted them\\nwith ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially to the sons\\nof Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply the Achaeans bought\\ntheir wine, some with bronze, some with iron, some with hides, some\\nwith whole heifers, and some again with captives. They spread a goodly\\nbanquet and feasted the whole night through, as also did the Trojans\\nand their allies in the city. But all the time Jove boded them ill and\\nroared with his portentous thunder. Pale fear got hold upon them, and\\nthey spilled the wine from their cups on to the ground, nor did any\\ndare drink till he had made offerings to the most mighty son of Saturn.\\nThen they laid themselves down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XIX\\n\\n  Achilles is reconciled with Agamemnon, puts on the armour\\n  which Vulcan had made him, and goes out to fight.\\n\\nNOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of\\nOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the\\nships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son\\nfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also of\\nhis followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came among\\nthem she clasped his hand in her own, saying, \"My son, grieve as we may\\nwe must let this man lie, for it is by heaven\\'s will that he has\\nfallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly armour,\\nwhich no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out\\nbravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none\\ndared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to\\nstill greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for he\\nwas glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had made\\nhim. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, he\\nsaid to his mother, \"Mother, the god has given me armour, meet\\nhandiwork for an immortal and such as no-one living could have\\nfashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon\\nthe son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his\\nbody, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\"\\n\\nSilver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, be not disquieted about this\\nmatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome\\nflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle. He\\nmay lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound as\\never, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly;\\nunsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might\\nand main.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she then\\ndropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus, that his\\nbody might suffer no change.\\n\\nThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called on\\nthe Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always at\\nthe ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were\\nabout the ships and served out rations, all came to the place of\\nassembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so\\nlong from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus,\\ncame limping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless they\\ncame, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of\\nall came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of\\nAntenor had struck him with a spear in battle.\\n\\nWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, \"Son of\\nAtreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,\\nwhen we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would have\\nbeen better, had Diana\\'s arrow slain her at the ships on the day when I\\ntook her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an Achaean the\\nless would have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my anger. It\\nhas been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the Achaeans will long\\nindeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let it be, for it is over.\\nIf we have been angry, necessity has schooled our anger. I put it from\\nme: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore, bid the Achaeans arm\\nforthwith that I may go out against the Trojans, and learn whether they\\nwill be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be\\nto rest his knees who may fly my spear when I wield it.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away\\nhis anger.\\n\\nThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the\\nmiddle of the assembly. \"Danaan heroes,\" said he, \"servants of Mars, it\\nis well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not seemly\\nto interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised speaker. Who\\ncan either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest orator will be\\ndisconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus, and do you\\nother Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the Achaeans spoken\\nto me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was not I that did it:\\nJove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in darkness struck me mad when we\\nwere assembled on the day that I took from Achilles the meed that had\\nbeen awarded to him. What could I do? All things are in the hand of\\nheaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove\\'s daughters, shuts men\\'s eyes to\\ntheir destruction. She walks delicately, not on the solid earth, but\\nhovers over the heads of men to make them stumble or to ensnare them.\\n\\n\"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest\\nwhether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him on\\nthe day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair\\ncity of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, \\'Hear me, all\\ngods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day\\nshall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child\\ninto the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him who are\\nof my blood and lineage.\\' Then said Juno all crafty and full of guile,\\n\\'You will play false, and will not hold to your word. Swear me, O\\nOlympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day fall\\nbetween the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell about\\nhim who are of your blood and lineage.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath,\\nto his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high summit\\nof Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that the\\nnoble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with child\\nand in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth though there\\nwas a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena, and\\nkept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of Saturn,\\nand said, \\'Father Jove, lord of the lightning--I have a word for your\\near. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus\\nthe son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well, therefore, that\\nhe should reign over the Argives.\\'\\n\\n\"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught\\nFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she again\\ninvade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then he\\nwhirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down from\\nheaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he was ever\\nangry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel labours\\nthat Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty Hector\\nwas killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time I kept\\nthinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove robbed me\\nof my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much treasure by\\nway of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your people with\\nyou. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you yesterday in your\\ntents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain fight at\\nonce, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship, that you may\\nsee whether what I give you is enough.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you can\\ngive such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them: it is in\\nyour own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not well to tarry\\ntalking about trifles, for there is a deed which is as yet to do.\\nAchilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost, and laying\\nlow the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of you when he\\nis fighting.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses said, \"Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans\\nthus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will be\\nno brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sides\\nwith fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships,\\nfor in this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle the\\nlivelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food;\\nhowever much he may want to fight his strength will fail him before he\\nknows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will grow\\nweary under him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed with\\nmeat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he\\nhas routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them\\nprepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts in presence\\nof the assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied.\\nMoreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that he has never\\ngone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her after the manner\\nof men and women; and do you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind;\\nlet Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with a feast of\\nreconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full. As for you,\\nson of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future; it is no\\ndisgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong in\\nthe first instance.\"\\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Son of Laertes, your words please me\\nwell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would\\nhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name\\nof heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fain fight\\nat once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from my tent\\nand we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge you:\\ntake some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from my tents the\\ngifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the women also;\\nfurthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those that are with the\\nhost, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and to the sun.\"\\n\\nThen said Achilles, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to these\\nmatters at some other season, when there is breathing time and when I\\nam calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those whom Hector\\nson of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain? Let the sons\\nof the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and without food, till we have\\navenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun let them eat\\ntheir fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying dead in my tent, all hacked\\nand hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades are mourning\\nround him. Therefore I can take thought of nothing save only slaughter\\nand blood and the rattle in the throat of the dying.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the\\nAchaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than a little,\\nbut in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater\\nknowledge. Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of\\nwhich men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is war\\'s steward, weighs the\\nupshot, it may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped\\nis far heavier than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should\\nmourn the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick and\\nthreefold continually; when should we have respite from our sorrow? Let\\nus mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but\\nlet those of us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight\\nour foes more fiercely. In that hour let no man hold back, waiting for\\na second summons; such summons shall bode ill for him who is found\\nlagging behind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and loose\\nthe fury of war upon the Trojans.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with Meges\\nson of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes, and\\nMelanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The word\\nwas not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out the seven\\ntripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty metal cauldrons\\nand the twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled in useful\\narts, seven in number, with Briseis, which made eight. Ulysses weighed\\nout the ten talents of gold and then led the way back, while the young\\nAchaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid them in the middle of\\nthe assembly.\\n\\nAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a god\\ncame to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife which he\\nwore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting off some\\nbristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as he did so.\\nThe other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly to hear\\nthe king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and prayed\\nsaying, \"I call Jove the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, I\\ncall also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who dwell below and take\\nvengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that I have laid no hand upon\\nthe girl Briseis, neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise, but that\\nshe has remained in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely may heaven\\nvisit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those who perjure\\nthemselves.\"\\n\\nHe cut the boar\\'s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled it\\nround his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes. Then\\nAchilles also rose and said to the Argives, \"Father Jove, of a truth\\nyou blind men\\'s eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had not else\\nstirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken Briseis from\\nme against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled the destruction of\\nmany an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that we may begin fighting.\"\\n\\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\\nship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to the\\nship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the stable-men\\ndrove the horses in among the others.\\n\\nBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of Patroclus,\\nflung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her breast, her neck,\\nand her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful as a goddess she\\nwept and said, \"Patroclus, dearest friend, when I went hence I left you\\nliving; I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows\\nmultiply upon me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father and\\nmother married me, cut down before our city, and my three own dear\\nbrothers perished with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus,\\neven when Achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes,\\ntold me that I was not to weep, for you said you would make Achilles\\nmarry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, we should have a wedding\\nfeast among the Myrmidons. You were always kind to me and I shall never\\ncease to grieve for you.\"\\n\\nShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making as\\nthough their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was weeping\\nfor her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round Achilles\\nand prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. \"I\\npray you,\" said he, \"if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat\\nnor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even to\\nthe going down of the sun.\"\\n\\nOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of\\nAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who\\nstayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow:\\nbut he would not be comforted till he should have flung himself into\\nthe jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of\\nPatroclus. Then he said--\\n\\n\"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner\\nready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were hasting\\nto fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and drink in\\nmy tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this I could\\nnot know, not even though I were to hear of the death of my father, who\\nis now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who am here\\nfighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake of Helen,\\nnor yet though I should hear that my son is no more--he who is being\\nbrought up in Scyros--if indeed Neoptolemus is still living. Till now I\\nmade sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy away from Argos, while\\nyou were to return to Phthia, bring back my son with you in your own\\nship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen, and the greatness of\\nmy house--for Peleus must surely be either dead, or what little life\\nremains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities of age and ever\\npresent fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of my death.\"\\n\\nHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought\\non what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn looked down\\nwith pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, \"My child, you have\\nquite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of your\\nrecollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss of\\nhis dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner he\\nwill neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar and ambrosia into\\nhis breast, that he may know no hunger.\"\\n\\nWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.\\nShe darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing on\\nhis broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming\\nthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosia\\ninto Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail\\nhim, she went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the\\nchill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne on the keen\\nblasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming helmets, the\\nbossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the ashen spears\\nstream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the whole land was\\nradiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of the tramp of their\\ntreading rose from under their feet. In the midst of them all Achilles\\nput on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire,\\nfor his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus, then, full of fury\\nagainst the Trojans, did he don the gift of the god, the armour that\\nVulcan had made him.\\n\\nFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and next\\nhe did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the silver-studded\\nsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield so\\ngreat and strong that shone afar with a splendour as of the moon. As\\nthe light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a fire in\\ntheir homestead high up among the mountains, but the sailors are\\ncarried out to sea by wind and storm far from the haven where they\\nwould be--even so did the gleam of Achilles\\' wondrous shield strike up\\ninto the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon his\\nhead, from whence it shone like a star, and the golden plumes which\\nVulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved all around\\nit. Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armour to see whether it\\nfitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and it seemed\\nto buoy him up as though it had been wings.\\n\\nHe also drew his father\\'s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so\\ngreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles\\nhad strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash from the\\ntopmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus,\\nfraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied\\nthemselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast\\nabout them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the reins back\\ntowards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind the\\nhorses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armour, resplendent as\\nthe sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he chided with his\\nfather\\'s horses saying, \"Xanthus and Balius, famed offspring of\\nPodarge--this time when we have done fighting be sure and bring your\\ndriver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him\\ndead on the plain as you did Patroclus.\"\\n\\nThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke--for white-armed Juno had\\nendowed him with human speech--and he bowed his head till his mane\\ntouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. \"Dread\\nAchilles,\" said he, \"we will indeed save you now, but the day of your\\ndeath is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be heaven\\nand stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth\\nor slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus of his\\narmour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him as he\\nfought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector. We two\\ncan fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetest of all winds;\\nnevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a man and of a god.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles\\nanswered him in great sadness, saying, \"Why, O Xanthus, do you thus\\nforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to\\nfall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,\\nshall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of\\nfighting.\"\\n\\nSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XXIII\\n\\n  The funeral of Patroclus, and the funeral games.\\n\\nThus did they make their moan throughout the city, while the Achaeans\\nwhen they reached the Hellespont went back every man to his own ship.\\nBut Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to his brave\\ncomrades saying, \"Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends,\\nnot yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with horse and chariot draw near\\nto the body and mourn Patroclus, in due honour to the dead. When we\\nhave had full comfort of lamentation we will unyoke our horses and take\\nsupper all of us here.\"\\n\\nOn this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them in\\ntheir lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing round\\nthe body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning. The\\nsands of the seashore and the men\\'s armour were wet with their weeping,\\nso great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost. Chief in all\\ntheir mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid his bloodstained hand on\\nthe breast of his friend. \"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroclus, even in\\nthe house of Hades. I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I\\nwill drag Hector hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons\\nof Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge you.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely, laying\\nit at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus. The others\\nthen put off every man his armour, took the horses from their chariots,\\nand seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of the fleet\\ndescendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with an abundant funeral\\nbanquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did they\\nbutcher and cut up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed, did\\nthey singe and set to roast in the flames of Vulcan; and rivulets of\\nblood flowed all round the place where the body was lying.\\n\\nThen the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus to Agamemnon,\\nbut hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so wroth was he\\nfor the death of his comrade. As soon as they reached Agamemnon\\'s tent\\nthey told the serving-men to set a large tripod over the fire in case\\nthey might persuade the son of Peleus to wash the clotted gore from\\nthis body, but he denied them sternly, and swore it with a solemn oath,\\nsaying, \"Nay, by King Jove, first and mightiest of all gods, it is not\\nmeet that water should touch my body, till I have laid Patroclus on the\\nflames, have built him a barrow, and shaved my head--for so long as I\\nlive no such second sorrow shall ever draw nigh me. Now, therefore, let\\nus do all that this sad festival demands, but at break of day, King\\nAgamemnon, bid your men bring wood, and provide all else that the dead\\nmay duly take into the realm of darkness; the fire shall thus burn him\\nout of our sight the sooner, and the people shall turn again to their\\nown labours.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made haste to\\nprepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so that\\nall were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\\nthe others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the son of\\nPeleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of the sounding\\nsea, in an open place where the waves came surging in one after\\nanother. Here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and eased the\\nburden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasing Hector\\nround windy Ilius. Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drew near him,\\nlike what he had been in stature, voice, and the light of his beaming\\neyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirit hovered over\\nhis head and said--\\n\\n\"You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living, but\\nnow that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with all speed\\nthat I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadows of men\\nthat can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will not yet\\nsuffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and I wander all\\ndesolate by the wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now your hand\\nI pray you, for when you have once given me my dues of fire, never\\nshall I again come forth out of the house of Hades. Nevermore shall we\\nsit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; the cruel fate which\\nwas my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around me--nay, you too\\nAchilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the wall of the noble\\nTrojans.\\n\\n\"One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not my\\nbones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even as we\\nwere brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius brought\\nme to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed\\nthe son of Amphidamas--not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel over\\nthe dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreated me\\nkindly, and named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones lie in\\nbut a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you by your\\nmother.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Why, true heart, are you come hither to lay\\nthese charges upon me? I will of my own self do all as you have bidden\\nme. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around one\\nanother, and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows.\"\\n\\nHe opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped him\\nin them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a vapour,\\ngibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his feet,\\nsmote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, \"Of a truth even in\\nthe house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that have no life in\\nthem; all night long the sad spirit of Patroclus has hovered over head\\nmaking piteous moan, telling me what I am to do for him, and looking\\nwondrously like himself.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning about\\nthe poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then King\\nAgamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring wood,\\nand Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them. They went\\nout with woodmen\\'s axes and strong ropes in their hands, and before\\nthem went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go, by straight\\nways and crooked, and when they reached the heights of many-fountained\\nIda, they laid their axes to the roots of many a tall branching oak\\nthat came thundering down as they felled it. They split the trees and\\nbound them behind the mules, which then wended their way as they best\\ncould through the thick brushwood on to the plain. All who had been\\ncutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones squire to Idomeneus had bidden\\nthem, and they threw them down in a line upon the seashore at the place\\nwhere Achilles would make a mighty monument for Patroclus and for\\nhimself.\\n\\nWhen they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole\\nground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achilles ordered\\nhis brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke each man his\\nhorses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour and mounted each\\nhis chariot--they and their charioteers with them. The chariots went\\nbefore, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their tens of\\nthousands after. In the midst of them his comrades bore Patroclus and\\ncovered him with the locks of their hair which they cut off and threw\\nupon his body. Last came Achilles with his head bowed for sorrow, so\\nnoble a comrade was he taking to the house of Hades.\\n\\nWhen they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they laid\\nthe body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethought him of\\nanother matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off the\\nyellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. He looked\\nall sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, \"Spercheius, in vain\\ndid my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home to my loved\\nnative land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb;\\nfifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at your springs, where\\nis your grove and your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings. Thus did my\\nfather vow, but you have not fulfilled his prayer; now, therefore, that\\nI shall see my home no more, I give this lock as a keepsake to the hero\\nPatroclus.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, and\\nall who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sun\\nwould have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presently\\nsaid to Agamemnon, \"Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the people\\nwill give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from\\nmourning; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting their\\ndinners: we, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what is wanted\\nhere, and let the other princes also stay by me.\"\\n\\nWhen King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their ships,\\nbut those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built a pyre a\\nhundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all sorrowfully\\nupon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep and oxen\\nbefore the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them and wrapped the\\nbody therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed carcases all round\\nit. Against the bier he leaned two-handled jars of honey and unguents;\\nfour proud horses did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning the while he\\ndid so. The dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay\\nand threw upon the pyre; he also put twelve brave sons of noble Trojans\\nto the sword and laid them with the rest, for he was full of bitterness\\nand fury. Then he committed all to the resistless and devouring might\\nof the fire; he groaned aloud and called on his dead comrade by name.\\n\"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroclus, even in the house of Hades; I am now\\ndoing all that I have promised you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans\\nshall the flames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall\\ndevour the flesh of Hector son of Priam.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector, for\\nJove\\'s daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, and anointed him\\nwith ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be torn when\\nAchilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover sent a dark\\ncloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the whole place where\\nHector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch his body.\\n\\nNow the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles therefore\\nbethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed to the two\\nwinds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. He made them\\nmany drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them to come and\\nhelp him that the wood might make haste to kindle and the dead bodies\\nbe consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying and started off to fetch the\\nwinds. They were holding high feast in the house of boisterous Zephyrus\\nwhen Iris came running up to the stone threshold of the house and stood\\nthere, but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came towards her\\nand each of them called her to him, but Iris would not sit down. \"I\\ncannot stay,\" she said, \"I must go back to the streams of Oceanus and\\nthe land of the Ethiopians who are offering hecatombs to the immortals,\\nand I would have my share; but Achilles prays that Boreas and shrill\\nZephyrus will come to him, and he vows them goodly offerings; he would\\nhave you blow upon the pyre of Patroclus for whom all the Achaeans are\\nlamenting.\"\\n\\nWith this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rent\\nthe air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on until\\nthey came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but when\\nthey reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames roared\\nunder the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow hard and\\nbeat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his double\\ncup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon the\\nspirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the ground until the\\nearth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning the bones of\\nhis bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his parents,\\neven so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of his comrade,\\npacing round the bier with piteous groaning and lamentation.\\n\\nAt length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light which\\nsaffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the flames fell\\nand the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond the Thracian\\nsea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. The son of Peleus\\nnow turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome with toil, till he\\nfell into a sweet slumber. Presently they who were about the son of\\nAtreus drew near in a body, and roused him with the noise and tramp of\\ntheir coming. He sat upright and said, \"Son of Atreus, and all other\\nprinces of the Achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere upon the fire\\nand quench it; let us then gather the bones of Patroclus son of\\nMenoetius, singling them out with care; they are easily found, for they\\nlie in the middle of the pyre, while all else, both men and horses, has\\nbeen thrown in a heap and burned at the outer edge. We will lay the\\nbones in a golden urn, in two layers of fat, against the time when I\\nshall myself go down into the house of Hades. As for the barrow, labour\\nnot to raise a great one now, but such as is reasonable. Afterwards,\\nlet those Achaeans who may be left at the ships when I am gone, build\\nit both broad and high.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. First they\\npoured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the fire.\\nWith many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their loved\\ncomrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of fat: they\\nthen covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside the tent.\\nThey marked off the circle where the barrow should be, made a\\nfoundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up the earth.\\nWhen they had thus raised a mound they were going away, but Achilles\\nstayed the people and made them sit in assembly. He brought prizes from\\nthe ships--cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen, women with\\nfair girdles, and swart iron.\\n\\nThe first prize he offered was for the chariot races--a woman skilled\\nin all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had ears for\\nhandles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the man who\\ncame in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare, unbroken,\\nand in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly cauldron that\\nhad never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as when it left the\\nmaker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prize was two talents\\nof gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke. Then\\nhe stood up and spoke among the Argives saying--\\n\\n\"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that lie\\nwaiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time I should\\ncarry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you know how far\\nmy steeds excel all others--for they are immortal; Neptune gave them to\\nmy father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself; but I shall hold\\naloof, I and my steeds that have lost their brave and kind driver, who\\nmany a time has washed them in clear water and anointed their manes\\nwith oil. See how they stand weeping here, with their manes trailing on\\nthe ground in the extremity of their sorrow. But do you others set\\nyourselves in order throughout the host, whosoever has confidence in\\nhis horses and in the strength of his chariot.\"\\n\\nThus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred\\nthemselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king of men, son of\\nAdmetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mighty\\nDiomed son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken\\nfrom Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him,\\nyellow-haired Menelaus son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses,\\nAgamemnon\\'s mare Aethe, and his own horse Podargus. The mare had been\\ngiven to Agamemnon by Echepolus son of Anchises, that he might not have\\nto follow him to Ilius, but might stay at home and take his ease; for\\nJove had endowed him with great wealth and he lived in spacious Sicyon.\\nThis mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaus put under the yoke.\\n\\nFourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus, made\\nready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father came up to\\nhim to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in but little\\nneed. \"Antilochus,\" said Nestor, \"you are young, but Jove and Neptune\\nhave loved you well, and have made you an excellent horseman. I need\\nnot therefore say much by way of instruction. You are skilful at\\nwheeling your horses round the post, but the horses themselves are very\\nslow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your chances. The other\\ndrivers know less than you do, but their horses are fleeter; therefore,\\nmy dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice whereby you may\\ninsure that the prize shall not slip through your fingers. The woodman\\ndoes more by skill than by brute force; by skill the pilot guides his\\nstorm-tossed barque over the sea, and so by skill one driver can beat\\nanother. If a man go wide in rounding this way and that, whereas a man\\nwho knows what he is doing may have worse horses, but he will keep them\\nwell in hand when he sees the doubling-post; he knows the precise\\nmoment at which to pull the rein, and keeps his eye well on the man in\\nfront of him. I will give you this certain token which cannot escape\\nyour notice. There is a stump of a dead tree--oak or pine as it may\\nbe--some six feet above the ground, and not yet rotted away by rain; it\\nstands at the fork of the road; it has two white stones set one on each\\nside, and there is a clear course all round it. It may have been a\\nmonument to some one long since dead, or it may have been used as a\\ndoubling-post in days gone by; now, however, it has been fixed on by\\nAchilles as the mark round which the chariots shall turn; hug it as\\nclose as you can, but as you stand in your chariot lean over a little\\nto the left; urge on your right-hand horse with voice and lash, and\\ngive him a loose rein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in,\\nthat the nave of your wheel shall almost graze the post; but mind the\\nstone, or you will wound your horses and break your chariot in pieces,\\nwhich would be sport for others but confusion for yourself. Therefore,\\nmy dear son, mind well what you are about, for if you can be first to\\nround the post there is no chance of any one giving you the go-by\\nlater, not even though you had Adrestus\\'s horse Arion behind you--a\\nhorse which is of divine race--or those of Laomedon, which are the\\nnoblest in this country.\"\\n\\nWhen Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in his\\nplace, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They then all\\nmounted their chariots and cast lots. Achilles shook the helmet, and\\nthe lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first; next came that of\\nKing Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son of Atreus and of\\nMeriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomed son of Tydeus, who\\nwas the best man of them all. They took their places in line; Achilles\\nshowed them the doubling-post round which they were to turn, some way\\noff upon the plain; here he stationed his father\\'s follower Phoenix as\\numpire, to note the running, and report truly.\\n\\nAt the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck them\\nwith the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. They flew\\nfull speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose from under\\nthem as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were all flying\\nin the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the ground, and\\nthen again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood erect, and\\ntheir hearts beat fast and furious in their lust of victory. Each kept\\ncalling on his horses, and the horses scoured the plain amid the clouds\\nof dust that they raised.\\n\\nIt was when they were doing the last part of the course on their way\\nback towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and it\\nwas seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheres now\\ntook the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallions of\\nDiomed. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus\\'s chariot, and he\\ncould feel their warm breath on his back and on his broad shoulders,\\nfor their heads were close to him as they flew over the course. Diomed\\nwould have now passed him, or there would have been a dead heat, but\\nPhoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his whip. Tears of anger fell\\nfrom his eyes as he saw the mares going on faster than ever, while his\\nown horses lost ground through his having no whip. Minerva saw the\\ntrick which Apollo had played the son of Tydeus, so she brought him his\\nwhip and put spirit into his horses; moreover she went after the son of\\nAdmetus in a rage and broke his yoke for him; the mares went one to one\\nside of the course, and the other to the other, and the pole was broken\\nagainst the ground. Eumelus was thrown from his chariot close to the\\nwheel; his elbows, mouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his forehead\\nwas bruised above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with tears and he could\\nfind no utterance. But the son of Tydeus turned his horses aside and\\nshot far ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength into them and covered\\nDiomed himself with glory.\\n\\nMenelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus called to\\nhis father\\'s horses. \"On with you both,\" he cried, \"and do your very\\nutmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of Tydeus,\\nfor Minerva has put running into them, and has covered Diomed with\\nglory; but you must overtake the horses of the son of Atreus and not be\\nleft behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will taunt you. Why, my good\\nfellows, are you lagging? I tell you, and it shall surely be--Nestor\\nwill keep neither of you, but will put both of you to the sword, if we\\nwin any the worse a prize through your carelessness. Fly after them at\\nyour utmost speed; I will hit on a plan for passing them in a narrow\\npart of the way, and it shall not fail me.\"\\n\\nThey feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space went\\nquicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the road had\\nsunk. The ground was broken, for the winter\\'s rain had gathered and had\\nworn the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus was making\\ntowards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but Antilochus\\nturned his horses out of the way, and followed him a little on one\\nside. The son of Atreus was afraid and shouted out, \"Antilochus, you\\nare driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the road is too narrow\\nhere, it will be wider soon, and you can pass me then; if you foul my\\nchariot you may bring both of us to a mischief.\"\\n\\nBut Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had not\\nheard him. They went side by side for about as far as a young man can\\nhurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his strength, and then\\nMenelaus\\'s mares drew behind, for he left off driving for fear the\\nhorses should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus, while\\npressing on in quest of victory, they might both come headlong to the\\nground. Menelaus then upbraided Antilochus and said, \"There is no\\ngreater trickster living than you are; go, and bad luck go with you;\\nthe Achaeans say not well that you have understanding, and come what\\nmay you shall not bear away the prize without sworn protest on my part.\"\\n\\nThen he called on his horses and said to them, \"Keep your pace, and\\nslacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner than\\nyours, for they are neither of them young.\"\\n\\nThe horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so that\\nthey were soon nearly up with the others.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses\\nwent, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust.\\nIdomeneus captain of the Cretans was first to make out the running, for\\nhe was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the most commanding\\npart of the ground. The driver was a long way off, but Idomeneus could\\nhear him shouting, and could see the foremost horse quite plainly--a\\nchestnut with a round white star, like the moon, on its forehead. He\\nstood up and said among the Argives, \"My friends, princes and\\ncounsellors of the Argives, can you see the running as well as I can?\\nThere seems to be another pair in front now, and another driver; those\\nthat led off at the start must have been disabled out on the plain. I\\nsaw them at first making their way round the doubling-post, but now,\\nthough I search the plain of Troy, I cannot find them. Perhaps the\\nreins fell from the driver\\'s hand so that he lost command of his horses\\nat the doubling-post, and could not turn it. I suppose he must have\\nbeen thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his mares have\\nleft the course and gone off wildly in a panic. Come up and see for\\nyourselves, I cannot make out for certain, but the driver seems an\\nAetolian by descent, ruler over the Argives, brave Diomed the son of\\nTydeus.\"\\n\\nAjax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, \"Idomeneus, why\\nshould you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when the mares\\nare still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the youngest, nor\\nyour eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always laying down the law.\\nYou have no right to do so, for there are better men here than you are.\\nEumelus\\'s horses are in front now, as they always have been, and he is\\non the chariot holding the reins.\"\\n\\nThe captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, \"Ajax you are an\\nexcellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in much\\nelse as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a tripod or\\ncauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose horses are\\nfirst. You will then know to your cost.\"\\n\\nAjax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there would\\nhave been yet further brawling between them, had not Achilles risen in\\nhis place and said, \"Cease your railing, Ajax and Idomeneus; it is not\\nseemly; you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do the like:\\nsit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding towards\\nthe winning-post and will be here directly. You will then both of you\\nknow whose horses are first, and whose come after.\"\\n\\nAs he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his whip\\nlustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they flew\\nover the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver, and the\\nchariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet horses.\\nThere was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and the horses\\ncame flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them in the middle\\nof the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chests fell in streams\\non to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from his goodly chariot, and\\nleaned his whip against his horses\\' yoke; brave Sthenelus now lost no\\ntime, but at once brought on the prize, and gave the woman and the\\near-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away. Then he unyoked the\\nhorses.\\n\\nNext after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had passed\\nMenelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; but even so\\nMenelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse that\\ndraws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of a horse\\'s tail\\ntouch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much space between\\nwheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelaus was no further than\\nthis behind Antilochus, though at first he had been a full disc\\'s throw\\nbehind him. He had soon caught him up again, for Agamemnon\\'s mare Aethe\\nkept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course had been\\nlonger he would have passed him, and there would not even have been a\\ndead heat. Idomeneus\\'s brave squire Meriones was about a spear\\'s cast\\nbehind Menelaus. His horses were slowest of all, and he was the worst\\ndriver. Last of them all came the son of Admetus, dragging his chariot\\nand driving his horses on in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry,\\nand stood up among the Argives saying, \"The best man is coming in last.\\nLet us give him a prize for it is reasonable. He shall have the second,\\nbut the first must go to the son of Tydeus.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying, and\\nwere for doing as he had said, but Nestor\\'s son Antilochus stood up and\\nclaimed his rights from the son of Peleus. \"Achilles,\" said he, \"I\\nshall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me of my\\nprize, because you think Eumelus\\'s chariot and horses were thrown out,\\nand himself too, good man that he is. He should have prayed duly to the\\nimmortals; he would not have come in last if he had done so. If you are\\nsorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in your tents, with\\nbronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something from this store if you\\nwould have the Achaeans speak well of you, and give him a better prize\\neven than that which you have now offered; but I will not give up the\\nmare, and he that will fight me for her, let him come on.\"\\n\\nAchilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus, who\\nwas one of his dearest comrades. So he said--\\n\\n\"Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I will\\ngive him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round it\\nwhich I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him.\"\\n\\nHe bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent, and\\nhe did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who received it\\ngladly.\\n\\nBut Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. An\\nattendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keep\\nsilence: the hero then addressed them. \"Antilochus,\" said he, \"what is\\nthis from you who have been so far blameless? You have made me cut a\\npoor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front of\\nthem, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, O princes\\nand counsellors of the Argives, judge between us and show no favour,\\nlest one of the Achaeans say, \\'Menelaus has got the mare through lying\\nand corruption; his horses were far inferior to Antilochus\\'s, but he\\nhas greater weight and influence.\\' Nay, I will determine the matter\\nmyself, and no man will blame me, for I shall do what is just. Come\\nhere, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is, whip in hand before your\\nchariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear by\\nearth-encircling Neptune that you did not purposely and guilefully get\\nin the way of my horses.\"\\n\\nAnd Antilochus answered, \"Forgive me; I am much younger, King Menelaus,\\nthan you are; you stand higher than I do and are the better man of the\\ntwo; you know how easily young men are betrayed into indiscretion;\\ntheir tempers are more hasty and they have less judgement; make due\\nallowances therefore, and bear with me; I will of my own accord give up\\nthe mare that I have won, and if you claim any further chattel from my\\nown possessions, I would rather yield it to you, at once, than fall\\nfrom your good graces henceforth, and do wrong in the sight of heaven.\"\\n\\nThe son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to Menelaus,\\nwhose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a field of\\nripening corn, and the lands are bristling with the harvest--even so, O\\nMenelaus, was your heart made glad within you. He turned to Antilochus\\nand said, \"Now, Antilochus, angry though I have been, I can give way to\\nyou of my own free will; you have never been headstrong nor\\nill-disposed hitherto, but this time your youth has got the better of\\nyour judgement; be careful how you outwit your betters in future; no\\none else could have brought me round so easily, but your good father,\\nyour brother, and yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on my\\nbehalf; I therefore yield to your entreaty, and will give up the mare\\nto you, mine though it indeed be; the people will thus see that I am\\nneither harsh nor vindictive.\"\\n\\nWith this he gave the mare over to Antilochus\\'s comrade Noemon, and\\nthen took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth, carried off\\nthe two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the two-handled urn,\\nbeing unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going up to him among the\\nassembled Argives and saying, \"Take this, my good old friend, as an\\nheirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroclus--for you shall see\\nhim no more among the Argives. I give you this prize though you cannot\\nwin one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight, and cannot enter for\\nthe javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of age has been laid\\nheavily upon you.\"\\n\\nSo saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly and\\nanswered, \"My son, all that you have said is true; there is no strength\\nnow in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands from either\\nshoulder. Would that I were still young and strong as when the Epeans\\nwere burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sons offered prizes\\nin his honour. There was then none that could vie with me neither of\\nthe Epeans nor the Pylians themselves nor the Aetolians. In boxing I\\novercame Clytomedes son of Enops, and in wrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron\\nwho had come forward against me. Iphiclus was a good runner, but I beat\\nhim, and threw farther with my spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus.\\nIn chariot-racing alone did the two sons of Actor surpass me by\\ncrowding their horses in front of me, for they were angry at the way\\nvictory had gone, and at the greater part of the prizes remaining in\\nthe place in which they had been offered. They were twins, and the one\\nkept on holding the reins, and holding the reins, while the other plied\\nthe whip. Such was I then, but now I must leave these matters to\\nyounger men; I must bow before the weight of years, but in those days I\\nwas eminent among heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests\\nin honour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart\\nrejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwill\\ntowards you, and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For all\\nwhich may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance.\"\\n\\nThereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks of\\nNestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, and presently\\noffered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He brought out a\\nstrong mule, and made it fast in the middle of the crowd--a she-mule\\nnever yet broken, but six years old--when it is hardest of all to break\\nthem: this was for the victor, and for the vanquished he offered a\\ndouble cup. Then he stood up and said among the Argives, \"Son of\\nAtreus, and all other Achaeans, I invite our two champion boxers to lay\\nabout them lustily and compete for these prizes. He to whom Apollo\\nvouchsafes the greater endurance, and whom the Achaeans acknowledge as\\nvictor, shall take the mule back with him to his own tent, while he\\nthat is vanquished shall have the double cup.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and of great stature,\\na skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his hand on the mule\\nand said, \"Let the man who is to have the cup come hither, for none but\\nmyself will take the mule. I am the best boxer of all here present, and\\nnone can beat me. Is it not enough that I should fall short of you in\\nactual fighting? Still, no man can be good at everything. I tell you\\nplainly, and it shall come true; if any man will box with me I will\\nbruise his body and break his bones; therefore let his friends stay\\nhere in a body and be at hand to take him away when I have done with\\nhim.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son of\\nMecisteus, who was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebes after\\nthe fall of Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all the people\\nof Cadmus. The son of Tydeus was Euryalus\\'s second, cheering him on and\\nhoping heartily that he would win. First he put a waistband round him\\nand then he gave him some well-cut thongs of ox-hide; the two men being\\nnow girt went into the middle of the ring, and immediately fell to;\\nheavily indeed did they punish one another and lay about them with\\ntheir brawny fists. One could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws,\\nand they sweated from every pore of their skin. Presently Epeus came on\\nand gave Euryalus a blow on the jaw as he was looking round; Euryalus\\ncould not keep his legs; they gave way under him in a moment and he\\nsprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the air near some shore\\nthat is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when Boreas furs the top of the\\nwaves, and then falls back into deep water. But noble Epeus caught hold\\nof him and raised him up; his comrades also came round him and led him\\nfrom the ring, unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one side, and\\nspitting great clots of gore. They set him down in a swoon and then\\nwent to fetch the double cup.\\n\\nThe son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest and\\nshowed them to the Argives. These were for the painful art of\\nwrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod ready for setting\\nupon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among themselves at twelve\\noxen. For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner of\\narts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among the\\nArgives, \"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\"\\n\\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty Ulysses,\\nfull of wiles, rose also. The two girded themselves and went into the\\nmiddle of the ring. They gripped each other in their strong hands like\\nthe rafters which some master-builder frames for the roof of a high\\nhouse to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked as they tugged at\\none another with their mighty arms--and sweat rained from them in\\ntorrents. Many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides and shoulders,\\nbut they kept on striving with might and main for victory and to win\\nthe tripod. Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him; Ulysses was too\\nstrong for him; but when the Achaeans began to tire of watching them,\\nAjax said to Ulysses, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall either\\nlift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it between us.\"\\n\\nHe lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did not forget\\nhis cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee, so that he\\ncould not keep his feet, but fell on his back with Ulysses lying upon\\nhis chest, and all who saw it marvelled. Then Ulysses in turn lifted\\nAjax and stirred him a little from the ground but could not lift him\\nright off it, his knee sank under him, and the two fell side by side on\\nthe ground and were all begrimed with dust. They now sprang towards one\\nanother and were for wrestling yet a third time, but Achilles rose and\\nstayed them. \"Put not each other further,\" said he, \"to such cruel\\nsuffering; the victory is with both alike, take each of you an equal\\nprize, and let the other Achaeans now compete.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on their\\nshirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.\\n\\nThe son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running--a\\nmixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold six\\nmeasures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty; it\\nwas the work of cunning artificers in Sidon, and had been brought into\\nport by Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a present of it\\nto Thoas. Eueneus son of Jason had given it to Patroclus in ransom of\\nPriam\\'s son Lycaon, and Achilles now offered it as a prize in honour of\\nhis comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. For the second\\nprize he offered a large ox, well fattened, while for the last there\\nwas to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and said among the\\nArgives, \"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\"\\n\\nForthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, and\\nNestor\\'s son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of his\\ntime. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal. The\\ncourse was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son of\\nOileus took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him as the\\nshuttle is to a woman\\'s bosom when she throws the woof across the warp\\nand holds it close up to her; even so close behind him was\\nUlysses--treading in his footprints before the dust could settle there,\\nand Ajax could feel his breath on the back of his head as he ran\\nswiftly on. The Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him straining\\nhis utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they were\\nnow nearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly to Minerva.\\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"and help my feet, O goddess.\" Thus did he pray,\\nand Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his hands and his feet\\nfeel light, and when the runners were at the point of pouncing upon the\\nprize, Ajax, through Minerva\\'s spite slipped upon some offal that was\\nlying there from the cattle which Achilles had slaughtered in honour of\\nPatroclus, and his mouth and nostrils were all filled with cow dung.\\nUlysses therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got before Ajax\\nand came in first. But Ajax took the ox and stood with his hand on one\\nof its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth. Then he said to the\\nArgives, \"Alas, the goddess has spoiled my running; she watches over\\nUlysses and stands by him as though she were his own mother.\" Thus did\\nhe speak and they all of them laughed heartily.\\n\\nAntilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to the\\nbystanders, \"You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown\\ntheir respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and as\\nfor Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale in\\nspite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against him save\\nonly Achilles.\"\\n\\nHe said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and Achilles\\nanswered, \"Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to no purpose; I\\nshall give you an additional half talent of gold.\" He then gave the\\nhalf talent to Antilochus, who received it gladly.\\n\\nThen the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield that\\nhad been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus. He\\nstood up and said among the Argives, \"We bid two champions put on their\\narmour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another in the\\npresence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound the flesh\\nof the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to him will I\\ngive this goodly Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which I took from\\nAsteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership, and I will\\ngive each of them a hearty meal in my own tent.\"\\n\\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty Diomed\\nson of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on his own side\\nof the ring, they both went into the middle eager to engage, and with\\nfire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelled as they beheld\\nthem, and when the two were now close up with one another, thrice did\\nthey spring forward and thrice try to strike each other in close\\ncombat. Ajax pierced Diomed\\'s round shield, but did not draw blood, for\\nthe cuirass beneath the shield protected him; thereon the son of Tydeus\\nfrom over his huge shield kept aiming continually at Ajax\\'s neck with\\nthe point of his spear, and the Achaeans alarmed for his safety bade\\nthem leave off fighting and divide the prize between them. Achilles\\nthen gave the great sword to the son of Tydeus, with its scabbard, and\\nthe leathern belt with which to hang it.\\n\\nAchilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion had\\nerewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and carried it\\noff in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and said among\\nthe Argives, \"Stand forward, you who would essay this contest. He who\\nwins it will have a store of iron that will last him five years as they\\ngo rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town his\\nshepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron, for\\nhe will have a stock of it on his own premises.\"\\n\\nThen uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax son\\nof Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the other and Epeus\\ntook the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which set all the\\nAchaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race of Mars. Ajax\\nson of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond any mark that had\\nbeen made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the quoit he hurled it\\nas though it had been a stockman\\'s stick which he sends flying about\\namong his cattle when he is driving them, so far did his throw\\nout-distance those of the others. All who saw it roared applause, and\\nhis comrades carried the prize for him and set it on board his ship.\\n\\nAchilles next offered a prize of iron for archery--ten double-edged\\naxes and ten with single edges: he set up a ship\\'s mast, some way off\\nupon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to it by the foot;\\nthis was what they were to aim at. \"Whoever,\" he said, \"can hit the\\npigeon shall have all the axes and take them away with him; he who hits\\nthe string without hitting the bird will have taken a worse aim and\\nshall have the single-edged axes.\"\\n\\nThen uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of Idomeneus\\nrose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot of Teucer fell\\nfirst. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but he did not promise\\nhecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, and missed his bird, for\\nApollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with which the bird was\\ntied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean through so that it\\nhung down towards the ground, while the bird flew up into the sky, and\\nthe Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, who had his arrow ready while\\nTeucer was aiming, snatched the bow out of his hand, and at once\\npromised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling lambs to\\nApollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under the\\nclouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as she was circling\\nupwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself in the\\nground at Meriones\\' feet, but the bird perched on the ship\\'s mast\\nhanging her head and with all her feathers drooping; the life went out\\nof her, and she fell heavily from the mast. Meriones, therefore, took\\nall ten double-edged axes, while Teucer bore off the single-edged ones\\nto his ships.\\n\\nThen the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had never\\nbeen on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a pattern of\\nflowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up--to wit the son of\\nAtreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart squire of\\nIdomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, \"Son of Atreus, we know how far\\nyou excel all others both in power and in throwing the javelin; take\\nthe cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it so please you, let\\nus give the spear to Meriones; this at least is what I should myself\\nwish.\"\\n\\nKing Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones, and\\nhanded the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.',\n",
       " 'Book VII\\n\\nRECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.\\n\\nThus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the\\ntown. When she reached her father\\'s house she drew up at the gateway,\\nand her brothers--comely as the gods--gathered round her, took the mules\\nout of the waggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while she\\nwent to her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit\\nthe fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira,\\nand had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over the\\nPhaeacians, and the people obeyed him as though he were a god. {57}\\nShe had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and\\nbrought her supper for her into her own room.\\n\\nPresently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed a\\nthick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud Phaeacians\\nwho met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was. Then, as he\\nwas just entering the town, she came towards him in the likeness of a\\nlittle girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front of him, and\\nUlysses said:\\n\\n\"My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous?\\nI am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in your\\ntown and country.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you\\nwant, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will go before\\nyou and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look\\nat any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide\\nstrangers, and do not like men who come from some other place. They are\\na sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships\\nthat glide along like thought, or as a bird in the air.\"\\n\\nOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one\\nof the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the\\nmidst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards\\nhim had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their\\nharbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city,\\nwhich, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when\\nthey reached the king\\'s house Minerva said:\\n\\n\"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you.\\nYou will find a number of great people sitting at table, but do not be\\nafraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is to\\ncarry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen. Her\\nname is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband Alcinous.\\nThey both descend originally from Neptune, who was father to Nausithous\\nby Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea was the youngest daughter\\nof Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over the giants, but he ruined his\\nill-fated people and lost his own life to boot.\\n\\n\"Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the\\ngreat Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithous had two\\nsons Rhexenor and Alcinous; {58} Apollo killed the first of them while\\nhe was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter\\nArete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as no other woman is honoured\\nof all those that keep house along with their husbands.\\n\\n\"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her\\nchildren, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon\\nher as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for\\nshe is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any\\nwomen are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to settle\\ntheir disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope\\nof seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to your home and\\ncountry.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to\\nMarathon {59} and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered\\nthe abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,\\nand he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold\\nof bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or\\nmoon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the\\ncornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of\\nsilver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver and\\nthe hook of the door was of gold.\\n\\nOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with\\nhis consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the\\npalace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow old.\\nSeats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end to the\\nother, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the house\\nhad made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit and eat\\nand drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there were golden\\nfigures of young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised on\\npedestals, to give light by night to those who were at table. There are\\n{60} fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always grinding\\nrich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom, or sit and\\nspin, and their shuttles go backwards and forwards like the fluttering\\nof aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that it will turn\\noil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so their women\\nexcel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them all manner of\\nuseful arts, and they are very intelligent.\\n\\nOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of\\nabout four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful\\ntrees--pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are\\nluscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor\\nfail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so\\nsoft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on\\npear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for\\nthere is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,\\nthe grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being\\ngathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on\\nhave shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again\\nare just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are\\nbeautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year\\nround. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts throughout the\\nwhole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the outer\\ncourt to the house itself, and the town\\'s people draw water from it.\\nSuch, then, were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the\\nhouse of king Alcinous.\\n\\nSo here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he\\nhad looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the\\nprecincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the\\nPhaeacians making their drink offerings to Mercury, which they always\\ndid the last thing before going away for the night. {61} He went\\nstraight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness\\nin which Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King\\nAlcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at\\nthat moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became\\nvisible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,\\nbut Ulysses began at once with his petition.\\n\\n\"Queen Arete,\" he exclaimed, \"daughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress\\nI humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests (whom may\\nheaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they leave their\\npossessions to their children, and all the honours conferred upon them\\nby the state) to help me home to my own country as soon as possible; for\\nI have been long in trouble and away from my friends.\"\\n\\nThen he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their\\npeace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent\\nspeaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty\\naddressed them thus:\\n\\n\"Alcinous,\" said he, \"it is not creditable to you that a stranger should\\nbe seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is waiting to\\nhear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and take a seat\\non a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix some wine and\\nwater that we may make a drink offering to Jove the lord of thunder,\\nwho takes all well disposed suppliants under his protection; and let\\nthe housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever there may be in the\\nhouse.\"\\n\\nWhen Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from\\nthe hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting\\nbeside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought him\\nwater in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for\\nhim to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper\\nservant brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there\\nwas in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous said to one\\nof the servants, \"Pontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand it round that\\nwe may make drink-offerings to Jove the lord of thunder, who is the\\nprotector of all well-disposed suppliants.\"\\n\\nPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving\\nevery man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and\\nhad drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:\\n\\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You\\nhave had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall\\ninvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial\\nbanquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his\\nescort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing to his\\nown country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no matter how\\ndistant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his\\nhomeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have to take\\nthe luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is\\npossible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who\\nhas come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods\\nare departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made\\nthemselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them\\nhecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,\\nand if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other\\nof them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the\\ngods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.\" {62}\\n\\nThen Ulysses said: \"Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into\\nyour head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body\\nnor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted.\\nIndeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me,\\nyou would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,\\nlet me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very\\nimportunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man\\'s notice no matter how\\ndire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I shall\\neat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only\\non the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose,\\nand at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content\\nto die if I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and all\\nthe greatness of my house.\" {63}\\n\\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he\\nshould have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when\\nthey had made their drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he\\nwas minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving\\nUlysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were\\ntaking the things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak,\\nfor she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses\\nwas wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said,\\n\"Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should like\\nto ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did\\nyou not say you had come here from beyond the sea?\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate\\nin full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid\\nheavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island far away\\nin the sea which is called \\'the Ogygian.\\' Here dwells the cunning and\\npowerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far\\nfrom all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however, brought me to\\nher hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my ship with his\\nthunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades were\\ndrowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried\\nhither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the\\ndarkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island\\nwhere the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me\\nwith the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I\\nmight never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let her do so.\\n\\n\"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good\\nclothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last\\nwhen the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will,\\neither because Jove had told her she must, or because she had changed\\nher mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she provisioned\\nwith abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good stout\\nclothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days seven\\nand ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught sight of\\nthe first outlines of the mountains upon your coast--and glad indeed was\\nI to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much trouble in\\nstore for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no further, and\\nraised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that I\\ncould no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of\\nthe gale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to\\nyour shores.\\n\\n\"There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the\\nwaves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam\\non till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for\\nthere were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I\\ngot out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was\\ncoming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered\\nmyself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off into a\\nvery deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all\\nnight, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke as the sun\\nwas westering, and saw your daughter\\'s maid servants playing upon the\\nbeach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought\\nher aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so\\nthan could be expected from so young a person--for young people are apt\\nto be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she\\nhad had me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you\\nsee me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told\\nyou the whole truth.\"\\n\\nThen Alcinous said, \"Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to\\nbring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she\\nwas the first person whose aid you asked.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do not scold her,\" replied Ulysses; \"she is not to blame. She did\\ntell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid,\\nfor I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human\\nbeing is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.\"\\n\\n\"Stranger,\" replied Alcinous, \"I am not the kind of man to get angry\\nabout nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father Jove,\\nMinerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how\\nmuch you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter,\\nand become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a house and\\nan estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here against your\\nown wish, and that you may be sure of this I will attend tomorrow to the\\nmatter of your escort. You can sleep {64} during the whole voyage if you\\nlike, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own\\nhome, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further\\noff than Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when they took\\nyellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the\\nfurthest of any place--and yet they did the whole voyage in a single day\\nwithout distressing themselves, and came back again afterwards. You\\nwill thus see how much my ships excel all others, and what magnificent\\noarsmen my sailors are.\"\\n\\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, \"Father Jove, grant that\\nAlcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable\\nname among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the\\nroom that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to\\nspread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to\\nwear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when\\nthey had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and said, \"Rise, sir\\nstranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,\" and glad indeed was\\nhe to go to his rest.\\n\\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but\\nAlcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife by\\nhis side.',\n",

There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which\\nhe should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who had been in the\\nhabit of misconducting themselves with them, left the house giggling and\\nlaughing with one another. This made Ulysses very angry, and he doubted\\nwhether to get up and kill every single one of them then and there, or\\nto let them sleep one more and last time with the suitors. His heart\\ngrowled within him, and as a bitch with puppies growls and shows her\\nteeth when she sees a stranger, so did his heart growl with anger at\\nthe evil deeds that were being done: but he beat his breast and said,\\n\"Heart, be still, you had worse than this to bear on the day when the\\nterrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in silence\\ntill your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you made sure of\\nbeing killed.\"\\n\\nThus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he\\ntossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front\\nof a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other, that he\\nmay get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn himself about\\nfrom side to side, thinking all the time how, single handed as he was,\\nhe should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked suitors.\\nBut by and by Minerva came down from heaven in the likeness of a woman,\\nand hovered over his head saying, \"My poor unhappy man, why do you lie\\nawake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside it, and\\nso is your son who is just such a young man as any father may be proud\\nof.\"\\n\\n\"Goddess,\" answered Ulysses, \"all that you have said is true, but I am\\nin some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors\\nsingle handed, seeing what a number of them there always are. And there\\nis this further difficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing\\nthat with Jove\\'s and your assistance I succeed in killing them, I must\\nask you to consider where I am to escape to from their avengers when it\\nis all over.\"\\n\\n\"For shame,\" replied Minerva, \"why, any one else would trust a worse\\nally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less wise\\nthan I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout\\nin all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though there were\\nfifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you should take\\nall their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you. But go to\\nsleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night, and you shall be\\nout of your troubles before long.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to\\nOlympus.\\n\\nWhile Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that\\neased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting\\nup in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping she\\nprayed to Diana saying, \"Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove, drive an\\narrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch me up and\\nbear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the mouths\\nof over-flowing Oceanus, as it did the daughters of Pandareus. The\\ndaughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods killed\\nthem, so they were left orphans. But Venus took care of them, and fed\\nthem on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them to excel all\\nwomen in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an imposing\\npresence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of accomplishment;\\nbut one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting\\nthem married (for well does he know both what shall happen and what\\nnot happen to every one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to\\nbecome handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods who\\nlive in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair Diana might\\nstrike me, for I would fain go even beneath the sad earth if I might\\ndo so still looking towards Ulysses only, and without having to yield\\nmyself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no matter how much people\\nmay grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as they can sleep at\\nnight, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget good and\\nill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in my dreams. This very\\nnight methought there was one lying by my side who was like Ulysses as\\nhe was when he went away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed\\nthat it was no dream, but the very truth itself.\"\\n\\nOn this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, and\\nit puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by\\nhis side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had\\nlain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock\\'s\\nhide out into the open. He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed,\\nsaying \"Father Jove, since you have seen fit to bring me over land and\\nsea to my own home after all the afflictions you have laid upon me, give\\nme a sign out of the mouth of some one or other of those who are now\\nwaking within the house, and let me have another sign of some kind from\\noutside.\"\\n\\nThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high\\nup among the clouds from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad\\nwhen he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from\\nhard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another sign.\\nThere were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grind wheat and\\nbarley which are the staff of life. The others had ground their task and\\nhad gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet finished, for\\nshe was not so strong as they were, and when she heard the thunder she\\nstopped grinding and gave the sign to her master. \"Father Jove,\" said\\nshe, \"you, who rule over heaven and earth, you have thundered from a\\nclear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and this means something for\\nsomebody; grant the prayer, then, of me your poor servant who calls\\nupon you, and let this be the very last day that the suitors dine in the\\nhouse of Ulysses. They have worn me out with labour of grinding meal for\\nthem, and I hope they may never have another dinner anywhere at all.\"\\n\\nUlysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman\\'s\\nspeech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should avenge\\nhimself on the suitors.\\n\\nThen the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;\\nTelemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about\\nhis shoulder, bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and took a\\ndoughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the\\nthreshold of the cloister and said to Euryclea, \"Nurse, did you make the\\nstranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let him\\nshift for himself?--for my mother, good woman though she is, has a\\nway of paying great attention to second-rate people, and of neglecting\\nothers who are in reality much better men.\"\\n\\n\"Do not find fault child,\" said Euryclea, \"when there is no one to find\\nfault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked:\\nyour mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and he said he\\nwould not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the servants to make one\\nfor him, but he said he was such a wretched outcast that he would not\\nsleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having an undressed\\nbullock\\'s hide and some sheepskins put for him in the cloister and I\\nthrew a cloak over him myself.\" {157}\\n\\nThen Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans\\nwere meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was not\\nalone, for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids and\\nsaid, \"Come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling\\nthem with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down\\nthe tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs\\nand the cups, and go for water from the fountain at once; the suitors\\nwill be here directly; they will be here early, for it is a feast day.\"\\n\\nThus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them\\nwent to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to\\nwork about the house. The men who were in attendance on the suitors also\\ncame up and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned from\\nthe fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three best pigs\\nhe could pick out. These he let feed about the premises, and then he\\nsaid good-humouredly to Ulysses, \"Stranger, are the suitors treating you\\nany better now, or are they as insolent as ever?\"\\n\\n\"May heaven,\" answered Ulysses, \"requite to them the wickedness with\\nwhich they deal high-handedly in another man\\'s house without any sense\\nof shame.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for\\nhe too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors\\' dinner; and he\\nhad two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse,\\nand then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. \"Are you still here,\\nstranger,\" said he, \"to pester people by begging about the house? Why\\ncan you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding\\nbefore we have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without\\nany sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the Achaeans,\\nas well as here?\"\\n\\nUlysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third\\nman, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and\\nsome goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there to take\\npeople over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made his heifer\\nand his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to the\\nswineherd. \"Who, Swineherd,\" said he, \"is this stranger that is lately\\ncome here? Is he one of your men? What is his family? Where does he come\\nfrom? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some great man, but the\\ngods give sorrow to whom they will--even to kings if it so pleases\\nthem.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand;\\n\"Good day to you, father stranger,\" said he, \"you seem to be very poorly\\noff now, but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father Jove,\\nof all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children, yet\\nyou show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions. A sweat came\\nover me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for he\\nreminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about in just such rags as\\nthis man\\'s are, if indeed he is still among the living. If he is already\\ndead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master, who made\\nme his stockman when I was quite young among the Cephallenians, and now\\nhis cattle are countless; no one could have done better with them than I\\nhave, for they have bred like ears of corn; nevertheless I have to keep\\nbringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed to his son though\\nhe is in the house, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already\\neager to divide Ulysses\\' property among them because he has been away so\\nlong. I have often thought--only it would not be right while his son\\nis living--of going off with the cattle to some foreign country; bad as\\nthis would be, it is still harder to stay here and be ill-treated about\\nother people\\'s herds. My position is intolerable, and I should long\\nsince have run away and put myself under the protection of some other\\nchief, only that I believe my poor master will yet return, and send all\\nthese suitors flying out of the house.\"\\n\\n\"Stockman,\" answered Ulysses, \"you seem to be a very well-disposed\\nperson, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will tell\\nyou, and will confirm my words with an oath. By Jove, the chief of all\\ngods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come, Ulysses\\nshall return before you leave this place, and if you are so minded you\\nshall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here.\"\\n\\n\"If Jove were to bring this to pass,\" replied the stockman, \"you should\\nsee how I would do my very utmost to help him.\"\\n\\nAnd in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.\\n\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to\\nmurder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand--an\\neagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, \"My friends,\\nthis plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to\\ndinner instead.\"\\n\\nThe others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the\\nbenches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the\\nheifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round.\\nThey mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every\\nman his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in the bread\\nbaskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then they laid their\\nhands upon the good things that were before them.\\n\\nTelemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that\\nwas paved with stone; {158} he gave him a shabby looking seat at a\\nlittle table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought\\nto him, with his wine in a gold cup. \"Sit there,\" said he, \"and drink\\nyour wine among the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and\\nblows of the suitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to\\nUlysses, and has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your\\nhands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will be mischief.\"\\n\\nThe suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;\\nthen Antinous said, \"We do not like such language but we will put up\\nwith it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove had\\nlet us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the\\nheralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the\\nAchaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.\\n\\nThen they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man\\nhis portion, and feasted to their heart\\'s content; those who waited\\nat table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for\\nTelemachus had told them to do so.\\n\\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their\\ninsolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against\\nthem. Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name\\nwas Ctesippus, and who came from Same. This man, confident in his\\ngreat wealth, was paying court to the wife of Ulysses, and said to the\\nsuitors, \"Hear what I have to say. The stranger has already had as\\nlarge a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor\\nreasonable to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I\\nwill, however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have\\nsomething to give to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses\\'\\nservants.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he picked up a heifer\\'s foot from the meat-basket in which\\nit lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little\\naside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion {159} as he did\\nso, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to\\nCtesippus, \"It is a good thing for you,\" said he, \"that the stranger\\nturned his head so that you missed him. If you had hit him I should have\\nrun you through with my spear, and your father would have had to see\\nabout getting you buried rather than married in this house. So let me\\nhave no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am grown up\\nnow to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on,\\ninstead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long seen\\nyou killing my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have put\\nup with this, for one man is no match for many, but do me no further\\nviolence. Still, if you wish to kill me, kill me; I would far rather die\\nthan see such disgraceful scenes day after day--guests insulted, and men\\ndragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said, \"No\\none should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it, for\\nit is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the stranger,\\nor any one else of the servants who are about the house; I would say,\\nhowever, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother, which I trust may\\ncommend itself to both. \\'As long,\\' I would say, \\'as you had ground for\\nhoping that Ulysses would one day come home, no one could complain of\\nyour waiting and suffering {160} the suitors to be in your house. It\\nwould have been better that he should have returned, but it is now\\nsufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all this\\nquietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man,\\nand the one who makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will\\nyourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink\\nin peace, while your mother will look after some other man\\'s house, not\\nyours.\\'\"\\n\\nTo this Telemachus answered, \"By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of my\\nunhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is wandering\\nin some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother\\'s\\nmarriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and\\nI will give her numberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not insist\\npoint blank that she shall leave the house against her own wishes.\\nHeaven forbid that I should do this.\"\\n\\nMinerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set\\ntheir wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter.\\nTheir meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears,\\nand their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this\\nand said, \"Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a shroud\\nof darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet with\\ntears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams\\ndrip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are full\\nof ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted out\\nof heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus\\nthen said, \"This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses.\\nServants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark\\nhere.\"\\n\\nBut Theoclymenus said, \"Eurymachus, you need not send any one with me.\\nI have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of an\\nunderstanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, for\\nI see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men who are\\ninsulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be\\nable to escape.\"\\n\\nHe left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him\\nwelcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking\\nTelemachus by laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to\\nhim, \"Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you have this\\nimportunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and has no skill\\nfor work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and now here is\\nanother fellow who is setting himself up as a prophet. Let me persuade\\nyou, for it will be much better to put them on board ship and send them\\noff to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.\"\\n\\nTelemachus gave him no heed, but sate silently watching his father,\\nexpecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.\\n\\nMeanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat\\nplaced for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could hear\\nwhat every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid much\\nmerriment; it had been both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed\\nmany victims; but the supper was yet to come, and nothing can be\\nconceived more gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a brave man\\nwere soon to lay before them--for they had brought their doom upon\\nthemselves.',\n",
       " 'Book VIII\\n\\nBANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS--THE GAMES.\\n\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous\\nand Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacian place\\nof assembly, which was near the ships. When they got there they sat down\\nside by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took the form\\nof one of Alcinous\\' servants, and went round the town in order to help\\nUlysses to get home. She went up to the citizens, man by man, and said,\\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, come to the assembly\\nall of you and listen to the stranger who has just come off a long\\nvoyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks like an immortal god.\"\\n\\nWith these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to the\\nassembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one was\\nstruck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified him\\nabout the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than he\\nreally was, that he might impress the Phaeacians favourably as being a\\nvery remarkable man, and might come off well in the many trials of skill\\nto which they would challenge him. Then, when they were got together,\\nAlcinous spoke:\\n\\n\"Hear me,\" said he, \"aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,\\nthat I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be,\\nhas found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East or\\nWest. He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled. Let\\nus then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before him;\\nindeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to complain\\nof me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us draw a ship into\\nthe sea--one that has never yet made a voyage--and man her with two and\\nfifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast\\nyour oars each by his own seat, leave the ship and come to my house to\\nprepare a feast. {65} I will find you in everything. I am giving these\\ninstructions to the young men who will form the crew, for as regards\\nyou aldermen and town councillors, you will join me in entertaining\\nour guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses, and we will have\\nDemodocus to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may\\nchoose to sing about.\"\\n\\nAlcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a\\nservant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to\\nthe sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew\\nthe ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound\\nthe oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due\\ncourse, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a\\nlittle way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the house\\nof King Alcinous. The out houses, {66} yards, and all the precincts were\\nfilled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and\\nAlcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two oxen.\\nThese they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet.\\n\\nA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had\\ndearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though\\nshe had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of\\nhis eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it\\nup against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his\\nhead, and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands. He also\\nset a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup of\\nwine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.\\n\\nThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before\\nthem, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse\\ninspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially\\na matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel\\nbetween Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on\\none another as they sat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad\\nwhen he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for Apollo\\nhad foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor to\\nconsult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by the will\\nof Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.\\n\\nThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head and\\ncovered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that he\\nwas weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his\\neyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to\\nthe gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further, for\\nthey delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his\\nhead and wept bitterly. No one noticed his distress except Alcinous, who\\nwas sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So\\nhe at once said, \"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, we\\nhave had enough now, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is\\nits due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports,\\nso that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends\\nhow much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and\\nrunners.\"\\n\\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A\\nservant hung Demodocus\\'s lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the\\ncloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief\\nmen of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of several\\nthousands of people followed them, and there were many excellent\\ncompetitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus,\\nPrymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus, and\\nAmphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also Euryalus son of\\nNaubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking man\\namong the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas,\\nHalios, and Clytoneus, competed also.\\n\\nThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the\\nstarting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew\\nforward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he\\nleft every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a couple\\nof mules can plough in a fallow field. {67} They then turned to the\\npainful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be the best man.\\nAmphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the disc\\nthere was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous\\'s son Laodamas\\nwas the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had all\\nbeen diverted with the games, \"Let us ask the stranger whether he excels\\nin any of these sports; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs,\\ncalves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at all\\nold, but he has suffered much lately, and there is nothing like the sea\\nfor making havoc with a man, no matter how strong he is.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite right, Laodamas,\" replied Euryalus, \"go up to your guest\\nand speak to him about it yourself.\"\\n\\nWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd\\nand said to Ulysses, \"I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for some\\none or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of them--and\\nyou must have gone in for many a one before now. There is nothing that\\ndoes any one so much credit all his life long as the showing himself a\\nproper man with his hands and feet. Have a try therefore at something,\\nand banish all sorrow from your mind. Your return home will not be long\\ndelayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water, and the crew is\\nfound.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind is\\nset rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite trouble,\\nand am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and people\\nto further me on my return home.\"\\n\\nThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, \"I gather, then, that you\\nare unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in. I\\nsuppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships\\nas captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward\\nfreights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to be much of the\\nathlete about you.\"\\n\\n\"For shame, Sir,\" answered Ulysses, fiercely, \"you are an insolent\\nfellow--so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in\\nspeech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence, but\\nheaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he charms\\nevery one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his hearers with\\nhim so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and wherever\\nhe goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome as a god, but his\\ngood looks are not crowned with discretion. This is your case. No god\\ncould make a finer looking fellow than you are, but you are a fool. Your\\nill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you are quite\\nmistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed, so\\nlong as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of the\\nage. Now, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone\\nthrough much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary\\nsea; still, in spite of all this I will compete, for your taunts have\\nstung me to the quick.\"\\n\\nSo he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,\\nlarger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians\\nwhen disc-throwing among themselves. {68} Then, swinging it back, he\\nthrew it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as\\nhe did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as\\nit sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been\\nmade yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked the place where\\nit had fallen. \"A blind man, Sir,\" said she, \"could easily tell your\\nmark by groping for it--it is so far ahead of any other. You may make\\nyour mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian can come near to\\nsuch a throw as yours.\"\\n\\nUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,\\nso he began to speak more pleasantly. \"Young men,\" said he, \"come up to\\nthat throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even\\nheavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I\\nam exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what it\\nis, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him because I\\nam his guest, and one cannot compete with one\\'s own personal friend.\\nAt least I do not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a guest\\nto challenge his host\\'s family at any game, especially when he is in a\\nforeign country. He will cut the ground from under his own feet if he\\ndoes; but I make no exception as regards any one else, for I want to\\nhave the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand\\nat every kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent\\narcher. In battle I am always the first to bring a man down with my\\narrow, no matter how many more are taking aim at him alongside of me.\\nPhiloctetes was the only man who could shoot better than I could when we\\nAchaeans were before Troy and in practice. I far excel every one else\\nin the whole world, of those who still eat bread upon the face of the\\nearth, but I should not like to shoot against the mighty dead, such as\\nHercules, or Eurytus the Oechalian--men who could shoot against the gods\\nthemselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his end,\\nfor Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged him\\nas an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an\\narrow. Running is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of\\nthe Phaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at\\nsea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, \"Sir, we have\\nhad much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which I\\nunderstand that you are willing to show your prowess, as having been\\ndispleased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one\\nof our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by any one who\\nknows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend my meaning,\\nand will explain to any one of your chief men who may be dining with\\nyourself and your family when you get home, that we have an hereditary\\naptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly\\nremarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are singularly\\nfleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good\\ndinners, music, and dancing; we also like frequent changes of linen,\\nwarm baths, and good beds, so now, please, some of you who are the best\\ndancers set about dancing, that our guest on his return home may be able\\nto tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as sailors,\\nrunners, dancers, and minstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre at my\\nhouse, so run some one or other of you and fetch it for him.\"\\n\\nOn this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king\\'s house,\\nand the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was\\ntheir business to manage everything connected with the sports, so\\nthey made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.\\nPresently the servant came back with Demodocus\\'s lyre, and he took his\\nplace in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in the town\\nbegan to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was delighted with the\\nmerry twinkling of their feet.\\n\\nMeanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how\\nthey first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus\\nmany presents, and defiled King Vulcan\\'s marriage bed, so the sun, who\\nsaw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he\\nheard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief,\\ngot his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some chains which\\nnone could either unloose or break, so that they might stay there in\\nthat place. {69} When he had finished his snare he went into his bedroom\\nand festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like cobwebs; he also\\nlet many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not even a god\\ncould see them so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had spread\\nthe chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting out for\\nthe fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was the one\\nhe was most fond of. But Mars kept no blind look out, and as soon as he\\nsaw him start, hurried off to his house, burning with love for Venus.\\n\\nNow Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was\\nabout sitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took\\nher hand in his own, \"Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is not at\\nhome, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is\\nbarbarous.\"\\n\\nShe was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest,\\nwhereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread\\nfor them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too\\nlate that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had\\nturned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun told him what\\nwas going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood in the vestibule\\nmaking a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the gods.\\n\\n\"Father Jove,\" he cried, \"and all you other blessed gods who live for\\never, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I will\\nshow you. Jove\\'s daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because I am\\nlame. She is in love with Mars, who is handsome and clean built, whereas\\nI am a cripple--but my parents are to blame for that, not I; they ought\\nnever to have begotten me. Come and see the pair together asleep on\\nmy bed. It makes me furious to look at them. They are very fond of one\\nanother, but I do not think they will lie there longer than they can\\nhelp, nor do I think that they will sleep much; there, however, they\\nshall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave him for his\\nbaggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest.\"\\n\\nOn this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling\\nNeptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the\\ngoddesses staid at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all\\ngood things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with\\ninextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,\\nwhereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:\\n\\n\"Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how\\nlimping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest god\\nin heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, \"Messenger\\nMercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains\\nwere, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?\"\\n\\n\"King Apollo,\" answered Mercury, \"I only wish I might get the chance,\\nthough there were three times as many chains--and you might look on, all\\nof you, gods and goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could.\"\\n\\nThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune took\\nit all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free again.\\n\"Let him go,\" he cried, \"and I will undertake, as you require, that\\nhe shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among the\\nimmortal gods.\"\\n\\n\"Do not,\" replied Vulcan, \"ask me to do this; a bad man\\'s bond is bad\\nsecurity; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go away\\nand leave his debts behind him along with his chains?\"\\n\\n\"Vulcan,\" said Neptune, \"if Mars goes away without paying his damages,\\nI will pay you myself.\" So Vulcan answered, \"In this case I cannot and\\nmust not refuse you.\"\\n\\nThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were\\nfree they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus to\\nCyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with\\nburnt offerings. Here the Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil\\nof ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they clothed her\\nin raiment of the most enchanting beauty.\\n\\nThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were\\ncharmed as they heard him.\\n\\nThen Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was no\\none to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus had made\\nfor them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up towards\\nthe clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and caught it\\nwith ease before it came down again. When they had done throwing the\\nball straight up into the air they began to dance, and at the same time\\nkept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one another, while all\\nthe young men in the ring applauded and made a great stamping with their\\nfeet. Then Ulysses said:\\n\\n\"King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the\\nworld, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was astonished\\nas I saw them.\"\\n\\nThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaeacians,\\n\"Aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems to be a person of\\nsingular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as\\nhe may reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men among you, and\\ncounting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean\\ncloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in\\na lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with a\\nlight heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a\\npresent too, for he has been rude.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and\\nsent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, \"King\\nAlcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require. He\\nshall have my sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of\\nsilver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into which\\nit fits. It will be worth a great deal to him.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, \"Good\\nluck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the\\nwinds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return,\\nfor I understand you have been long away from home, and have gone\\nthrough much hardship.\"\\n\\nTo which Ulysses answered, \"Good luck to you too my friend, and may the\\ngods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you\\nhave given me along with your apology.\"\\n\\nWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards\\nsundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants of\\nthe donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here his\\nsons received them, and placed them under their mother\\'s charge. Then\\nAlcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take their seats.\\n\\n\"Wife,\" said he, turning to Queen Arete, \"Go, fetch the best chest we\\nhave, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the\\nfire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to\\nthe careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made\\nhim; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that\\nwill follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet--which is of\\nexquisite workmanship--that he may be reminded of me for the rest of his\\nlife whenever he makes a drink offering to Jove, or to any of the gods.\"\\n{70}\\n\\nThen Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast as\\nthey could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear\\nfire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became hot\\nas the flame played about the belly of the tripod. {71} Meanwhile Arete\\nbrought a magnificent chest from her own room, and inside it she packed\\nall the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the Phaeacians had\\nbrought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from Alcinous, and\\nsaid to Ulysses:\\n\\n\"See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, for\\nfear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your\\nship.\" {72}\\n\\nWhen Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast\\nwith a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper\\nservant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very glad\\nof a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he\\nleft the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her had taken\\nas good care of him as though he had been a god. When the servants had\\ndone washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him a clean cloak\\nand shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests who were sitting\\nover their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the bearing-posts\\nsupporting the roof of the cloister, and admired him as she saw him\\npass. \"Farewell stranger,\" said she, \"do not forget me when you are safe\\nat home again, for it is to me first that you owe a ransom for having\\nsaved your life.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses said, \"Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove the\\nmighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; so shall I bless\\nyou as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved me.\"\\n\\nWhen he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was\\nthen served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the\\nfavourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company, near\\none of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean\\nagainst it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of\\nfat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant,\\n\"Take this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell him to eat it; for\\nall the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less;\\nbards are honoured and respected throughout the world, for the muse\\nteaches them their songs and loves them.\"\\n\\nThe servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who took\\nit and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the good\\nthings that were before them, and as soon as they had had to eat and\\ndrink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, \"Demodocus, there is no one in the\\nworld whom I admire more than I do you. You must have studied under the\\nMuse, Jove\\'s daughter, and under Apollo, so accurately do you sing the\\nreturn of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you\\nwere not there yourself, you must have heard it all from some one who\\nwas. Now, however, change your song and tell us of the wooden horse\\nwhich Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got\\nby stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who\\nafterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will\\ntell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you.\"\\n\\nThe bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some of\\nthe Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others, hidden\\nwithin the horse, {73} were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan place\\nof assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their\\nfortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it, and\\nwere in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for breaking it\\nup then and there; others would have it dragged to the top of the rock\\non which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice; while\\nyet others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation\\nfor the gods. And this was how they settled it in the end, for the city\\nwas doomed when it took in that horse, within which were all the bravest\\nof the Argives waiting to bring death and destruction on the Trojans.\\nAnon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans issued from the horse, and\\nsacked the town, breaking out from their ambuscade. He sang how they\\noverran the city hither and thither and ravaged it, and how Ulysses went\\nraging like Mars along with Menelaus to the house of Deiphobus. It was\\nthere that the fight raged most furiously, nevertheless by Minerva\\'s\\nhelp he was victorious.\\n\\nAll this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his\\ncheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws\\nherself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city\\nand people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and children. She\\nscreams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for\\nbreath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back\\nand shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to a life of labour and\\nsorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks--even so piteously did\\nUlysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except\\nAlcinous, who was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs\\nthat he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:\\n\\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease\\nhis song, for there are those present who do not seem to like it. From\\nthe moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to sing, our\\nguest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently\\nin great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy\\nourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should\\nbe, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that we\\nare making with so much good will are wholly in his honour, and any\\none with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to\\ntreat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.\\n\\n\"Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor\\nreserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more\\npolite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your\\nfather and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which you were\\nknown among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is no one,\\nneither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name whatever, for\\npeople\\'s fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born.\\nTell me also your country, nation, and city, that our ships may shape\\ntheir purpose accordingly and take you there. For the Phaeacians have\\nno pilots; their vessels have no rudders as those of other nations have,\\nbut the ships themselves understand what it is that we are thinking\\nabout and want; they know all the cities and countries in the whole\\nworld, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is covered\\nwith mist and cloud, so that there is no danger of being wrecked or\\ncoming to any harm. Still I do remember hearing my father say that\\nNeptune was angry with us for being too easy-going in the matter of\\ngiving people escorts. He said that one of these days he should wreck a\\nship of ours as it was returning from having escorted some one, {74} and\\nbury our city under a high mountain. This is what my father used to say,\\nbut whether the god will carry out his threat or no is a matter which he\\nwill decide for himself.\\n\\n\"And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, and\\nin what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples themselves,\\nand of their cities--who were hostile, savage and uncivilised, and who,\\non the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us also why you are made\\nso unhappy on hearing about the return of the Argive Danaans from Troy.\\nThe gods arranged all this, and sent them their misfortunes in order\\nthat future generations might have something to sing about. Did you\\nlose some brave kinsman of your wife\\'s when you were before Troy? a\\nson-in-law or father-in-law--which are the nearest relations a man has\\noutside his own flesh and blood? or was it some brave and kindly-natured\\ncomrade--for a good friend is as dear to a man as his own brother?\"']"
